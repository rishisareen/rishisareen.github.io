<p>This is my digital garden - a collection of notes, ideas, and thoughts that I'm cultivating over time.</p>

<h2>What's Here</h2>

<p>Unlike polished articles, these notes are:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Work in progress</strong> - constantly evolving</li>
  <li><strong>Interconnected</strong> - ideas link to each other</li>
  <li><strong>Personal</strong> - my own understanding, not universal truths</li>
</ul>

<h2>How to Navigate</h2>

<p>Browse the folders on the left to explore different topics:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Productivity</strong> - systems, habits, routines</li>
  <li><strong>Fitness</strong> - training, recovery, performance</li>
  <li><strong>Books</strong> - reading notes and key takeaways</li>
</ul>

<h2>Philosophy</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>"A garden is never finished. It's a living thing that grows and changes."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Feel free to explore. Some notes are seeds, others are fully grown.</p>
