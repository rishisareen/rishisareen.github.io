    <p>Hey there! I'm Rishi.</p>
    <p>I'm an endurance athlete, avid reader, and someone who loves pushing boundaries. What started as a bucket list item – completing a triathlon – has become a full-blown passion. I've finished multiple Ironman races and love sharing what I learn along the way.</p>

When I'm not training, you'll find me deep in a book. Started with fiction (Jeffrey Archer, PG Wodehouse, Sherlock Holmes) and now I'm obsessed with the science of habits, nutrition, and sports performance.

This site is where I share race reports, book notes, and things I'm learning about fitness and productivity. Always a work in progress.
