Running is a rewarding journey, but as with any new activity, starting the right way is crucial. 

The body’s ability to handle the demands of running boils down to two essential areas: muscular and cardiovascular strength. 

Ignoring these can lead to injuries or burnout, making your running journey short-lived.

Studies show that about **50-65% of runners** get injured each year. Most injuries are overuse-related, stemming from improper training loads, running form issues, or inadequate recovery.

Don't be part of that statistics. Train smart. Play the long game. 



### 1. Running - Body Fundamentals

Your muscles and cardiovascular system work together to power you through a run. 

- **Muscles** stabilize your body, absorb impact, and generate the force required for movement, 
- **Cardiovascular system** ensures that oxygen and nutrients are efficiently delivered to these muscles. 

For beginners, building both is crucial to avoid stress on the joints and overexertion on the heart.


   ### 2. Why You Should Take it Easy

   - Many new runners make the mistake of pushing too hard, too soon. 

   - It's tempting to chase longer distances or faster times, but this can lead to burnout or injury. 

   - Your body needs time to adapt, especially if running is new to you. 

   This is why it’s essential to take it **easy in the beginning**—running at a comfortable pace, where you can **hold a conversation**, helps your muscles, ligaments, and cardiovascular system gradually develop strength without undue strain.

   

   ### 3. The 80-20 Rule: Balance is Key

   * The 80-20 rule is a guiding principle for effective training. 

   * 80% of your running should be done at a low, easy pace, while the remaining 20% can be more intense. 

   This approach allows for cardiovascular endurance to build gradually while reducing the risk of injury or overtraining. The low-intensity efforts help build aerobic fitness (essential for long-term stamina), while the higher-intensity sessions develop speed and strength.

   

   #### 4. How to know you are running _easy_

   - If you have a heart rate monitor, follow [MAF Method](https://rishisareen.com/blog/running/2019/03/10/maf-method-part1.html)

   - If you do not have a heart rate monitor, do the "sing a song" routine. Basically, if you can hum your favorite song comfortably, you are running at a comfortable pace. 

     

   ### 5. A Week to Get Started

   Here’s a balanced weekly schedule for beginners focusing on both muscular and cardiovascular strength:

   - **Day 1:** Easy 20-minute run/walk (80% easy pace)
   - **Day 2:** Strength training (focus on core and legs)
   - **Day 3:** 25-minute easy run (80% easy pace)
   - **Day 4:** Rest or active recovery (light stretching or yoga)
   - **Day 5:** Interval run (5-minute warm-up, 2 minutes fast, 3 minutes easy, repeat 4x)
   - **Day 6:** Strength training (upper body and core)
   - **Day 7:** Rest

   By following this plan and focusing on gradual improvement, you’ll not only develop the strength necessary to become a better runner, but you’ll also enjoy the process and stay injury-free.

## Bonus Notes

Above points are all in terms of biomechanics of running. But even though running is a simple sport, it can be overwhelming for beginners. As in anything in life, best way (and the magic pill) is consistency and goal. So along with the above approach, consider two very important strategies to start as runner:

### 1. Pick a Goal

Sign up for a local race. If you're starting out, 5k or 10k is a good start. This will give you a tangible target to focus on. It will be your [SMART](https://www.mindtools.com/a4wo118/smart-goals) goal.

### 2. Get Community

All around the world, there are running communities. Find something close to your home and join it. Most of communities are very welcoming. Communities provides the guidance, accountability and social structure - all essential as a beginner.
