### Capturing Web Articles with Readwise:
- I am using a service called [Readwise](https://readwise.io). This is a category of "Read it later" app. The whole concept is when you find an article of interest, you do not read it immediately but "save it" using Readwise extension in your browser.
- I was earlier using a free service called Omnivore. Alas, it is shut down now. 

### Configuration
**a. Using the Readwise Web Clipper:**
1. **Install the Readwise Web Clipper** (available for Chrome and other browsers):
• Go to the [Readwise Web Clipper page](https://readwise.io/) and add the extension to your browser.
• After installation, you’ll see a Readwise icon in your browser.

2. **Save Articles to Readwise**:
• When you find an article you want to save, click the Readwise icon in your browser.
• You can select the title, a snippet, and tags, and save it to your Readwise account.

3. **Sync to Obsidian**:
• Once your articles are saved in Readwise, they can be exported to Obsidian.
• Readwise offers automatic sync with Obsidian through their **Readwise to Obsidian integration**.

4. **Set up Readwise Sync**:
• In Readwise, go to **Settings** → **Integrations**.
• Choose **Obsidian** and follow the instructions to sync.
• This will create markdown files in your Obsidian vault that contain the article content, along with any tags you used in Readwise.
