## Highlights

> ### **The Foundation: C.O.D.E. + P.A.R.A.**
> 
> Forte‚Äôs methodology consists of two core components: C.O.D.E. (Capture, Organize, Distill, Express) and P.A.R.A (Projects, Areas, Resources, Archives). The first is the workflow for using and maintaining your second brain. The second helps you organize notes into folders.
> 
> #### **C.O.D.E. (Capture, Organize, Distill, Express)**
> 
> ##### 1\. **Capture**
> 
> Your second brain needs information to grow. In this stage, you capture all kinds of notes, and resources into four containers (more on that in a bit). Whether you‚Äôre highlighting passages from a book or saving snippets of conversations, there are a few rules to keep in mind:
> 
> * **‚ù§Ô∏è Keep what resonates:** This is a gut check about the information you capture. Ideas that ‚Äúresonate‚Äù may be unusual, counterintuitive, or interesting. More often than not, they refute what you already know. Follow your intuition and be selective.
> * **üç∞ 10% of the original content:** Reading a book or an article online? Highlight what‚Äôs interesting, save snippets, but don‚Äôt go crazy with it. Forte recommends capturing no more than 10% of the source. It will save you some organizing and editing later on.
> * **‚ö° Do it quickly:** Don‚Äôt overthink. If a passage in a book strikes a chord, highlight it and keep reading. If a YouTube video has something you‚Äôre interested in, save the link with a time stamp and move on. You‚Äôll zoom in on the information in the next stage.
> * **‚úÇÔ∏è Use capturing tools:** BASB is all about efficiency. Look for ways to optimize note-taking. Typing on your keyboard rather than with a pen is one thing. Web clippers, screenshot tools, and OCR software will take your second brain to the next level.

My Notes:
- Capture Articles with "Read it Later"
- Highlight and Summarize

> ##### 2\. **Organize (P.A.R.A.)**
> 
> Folders and notes, that‚Äôs all you need to organize your second brain. Instead of dumping things into dozens of ambiguously named piles, Forte recommends the P.A.R.A. (Projects, Areas, Resources, Archives) approach, a set of four (yes!) folders to capture everything,
> 
> * **üìÇ Folder #1: Projects**  
>    * These are active projects you‚Äôre working on. Projects have a fixed timeline, clear deadlines, and specific tasks you need to complete. Most people have five to fifteen projects going on at the same time. Projects can be anything from writing a book to developing an app or learning a new language.
> * **üìÇ Folder #2: Areas**  
>    * Areas are long-term responsibilities and future goals. They focus on specific domains in your life like health, finance, or self-development. Areas are umbrella categories and can spawn individual projects. For instance, the area of ‚Äúhealth‚Äù can lead to projects like ‚Äúlose 20 pounds‚Äù or ‚Äúprepare for Ironman 2023.‚Äù
> * **üìÇ Folder #3: Resources**  
>    * Think of Resources as your Misc folder. If you come across something interesting that doesn‚Äôt have a clear connection to one of the active projects or areas, you dump it here. You can create Resources for hobbies and interests, life hacks, or any other topics you may want to reference at some point in the future.
> * **üìÇ Folder #4: Archives**  
>    * The Archives folder includes completed, canceled, or deferred projects. Any projects you‚Äôre not actively working on should end up in the Archives folder. The Archives are a valuable resource when starting new projects, so you should get into the habit of moving notes here rather than deleting them.

My Notes: PARA Method requires a complete separate focus. But my crux - pick a portable note taking app and stick to it. This is heart of Second Brain

> ##### 3\. **Distill (Progressive Summarization)**
> 
> You have your notes and folders in a personal knowledge base. So now what? 
> 
> Your notes, as compact as they may be, are still in a raw format. According to Forte, this is where most note-takers give up. You‚Äôve probably created many intricate systems, captured a lot of valuable content, and then let those notes collect digital dust. But not this time.
> 
> Once you‚Äôve captured notes into your second brain, you need to distill them. In a nutshell, every time you revisit an entry, you need to chew on it, read and reread, and extract the core message. 
> 
> This is where Progressive Summarization comes in.
> 
> * **üì• Level 1: Raw Format**  
>    * First, read, listen to, or watch source material and capture the interesting bits. You can highlight passages in books/articles, save code snippets, or save show notes from a podcast. Remember, 10% is enough, so choose wisely.
> * **üÖ±Ô∏è Level 2: Bold**  
>    * Once you‚Äôve added the highlighted passages to your second brain, it‚Äôs time to refine them. Read and reread the material and bold the really important parts. Focus on keywords and tips that reflect the core message.
> * **üü° Level 3: Highlight**  
>    * ‚ÄúMore highlighting?‚Äù Yes! The bolded passages may be the cr√®me de la cr√®me but there‚Äôs still room for improvement. If you‚Äôre dealing with a long and complex note, highlight bits of the bolded passages and scrap the rest.
> * **üìù Level 4: Create an executive summary**  
>    * Sometimes you may come across a particularly lengthy note that‚Äôs difficult to encapsulate in a sentence or two. For such notes, add a bulleted summary at the top and try to describe what the note is about in your own words.

My Notes: As Tiago says, this is where most of people drop the ball. Information is only useful if it is used. 

> ##### 4\. **Express**
> 
> Gathering knowledge for the sake of it is pointless. 
> 
> Sure, you may nurture your little garden, walk around and marvel at all the notes and ideas you‚Äôve collected. But hey, you‚Äôre in the knowledge game. And that means you need to make the best use of what‚Äôs in your second brain and create new value out of it.
> 
> Here‚Äôs how to do that. üëá
> 
> * **üß± Use Intermediate Packets:** Intermediate packets are chunks of work, both past and present, that you can reuse in future projects. That can include distilled notes (see the previous step), unused resources, presentation slides, or checklists, just to name a few. Build on top of those blocks to kickstart new projects much quicker.
> * **üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Work in increments:** Don‚Äôt wait until you‚Äôre ready to write your 600-word bestseller. Start with an outline, progress to a paragraph, and the next thing you know, you‚Äôll have a whole chapter in place. Deliver your work in increments, even if that means writing non-stop for just 30 minutes each day. Consistency is king.
> * ü§π **Embrace remixing:** Every idea and project piggybacks on the ones you had or completed in the past. Look back at your intermediate packets and find ways to incorporate them into your work. Shake things up, spot contradictions, build better arguments, and always have a bunch of building blocks at the ready.

My Notes: This is optional step , not clear the link between Distill and Express. Maybe express is final collection.
