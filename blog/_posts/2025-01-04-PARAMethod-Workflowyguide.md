> PARA is a methodology for organizing digital information and activities in a way that is simple, useful, and flexible. PARA itself is an acronym that stands for 'Projects', 'Areas', 'Resources', and 'Archives' - which are the four main categories that make it up.

> 
> The PARA method works by grouping information into four main categories. 'Projects', 'Areas', 'Resources', and 'Archives'.   
> Projects being the most actionable category and Archives the least. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/para-method-workflowy-guide-18d50eaa2a9#7d5c6e40-c67e-496e-8b8b-5ed909cacfd2)  ^7d5c6e40

> **Projects**  
> This is where your active projects will go. Projects are defined as a collection of tasks that are connected to a goal and have a set deadline. These are the concrete activities you want to or need to do.
> 
> PARA starts with projects and not tasks as a way to give the system more structure and make it easier to align activities with goals. It's simply easier to group tasks by project and see the progress of a handful of projects vs dozens of individual tasks. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/para-method-workflowy-guide-18d50eaa2a9#8bd2baf4-23e1-414b-bbbe-2421a1b69f18)  ^8bd2baf4

> **Areas (of responsibility)**  
> The Areas section represents ongoing activities with no set deadline. So things like finances, writing, sales, health. These should be things that require constant upkeep and attention. New projects will generally come from this section as a result of that continual upkeep. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/para-method-workflowy-guide-18d50eaa2a9#408fc25a-999c-4c91-bc40-dc16f2ef083e)  ^408fc25a

> **Resources**  
> This section is for holding information around topics that are interesting or useful to you. As the name suggests, these are pieces of information that you would like to keep and refer to in the future. Items from here could feed into existing or new areas you'd like to actively explore.
> 
> You can also think of it as your library where you collect information to later use, transform, or repurpose somehow. 
> 
> One key difference between resources and areas is that resources should be things you're interested in while areas is meant for things you're responsible for. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/para-method-workflowy-guide-18d50eaa2a9#fec88ed9-2adb-4d39-b9c7-8cbe3a5f291b)  ^fec88ed9

> **Archives**  
> Lastly, the archives is where you'll put items from the other three categories that have been completed or are no longer active. So things like complete projects, areas that are no longer active or resources that you are no longer interested in actively maintaining. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/para-method-workflowy-guide-18d50eaa2a9#4051639c-4676-40fd-9d5e-a82638b32345)  ^4051639c

> How do I actually use the PARA method [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/para-method-workflowy-guide-18d50eaa2a9#d155a55e-4f2e-4551-8c89-042b86c5b897)  ^d155a55e

> Tiago recommends you update the system in what he calls 'just-in-time organization'. Essentially that means you organize things in your system as a natural consequence of your work and needs. Instead of scheduling specific chunks of time to do the organization, you simply start working with your system and organize as you go. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/para-method-workflowy-guide-18d50eaa2a9#3e994d61-04a1-4563-ab4c-d6f7a8f18db2)  ^3e994d61

> **Information flows**  
> As you use your system, you'll notice there are several flows of information going on. Items will move from one category to another and back.

> Items that start out as projects might become areas that you'll need to maintain, or you'll generate resources that you'll want to use later, and finally the project itself will end up in the archive once you're done.

> And Archives could become useful in the future as a source of inspiration or documents you'll be able to reuse. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/para-method-workflowy-guide-18d50eaa2a9#57a145d1-a8d2-4c81-a92f-16f90059cc5e)  ^57a145d1
