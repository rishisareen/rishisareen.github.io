## **1. The Life-Changing Power of a Not-To-Do List**

Ever feel like your to-do list just keeps growing, no matter how much you check off? You start the week feeling ambitious, but by Friday, you're drained, wondering where all the time went.

Yeah, same.

That’s when I discovered the magic of a **Not-To-Do List** — and it changed everything.

Turns out, what you *don’t* do is just as important as what you do. Every pointless meeting, every mindless Instagram scroll, every “yes” to someone else’s priorities quietly steals time and energy from what truly matters.

Bruce Lee famously said:

> "It is not daily increase but daily decrease, hack away the unessential."

I didn’t get that at first. Saying no felt selfish. But over time, I realized that every “no” was actually a “yes” to something better — more focused work, deeper relationships, and space to breathe.

So, let’s talk about building a Not-To-Do List. A simple tool that helps you avoid what drains you, so you can double down on what moves you forward. Trust me, it’s a game-changer.



## **2. Why a Not-To-Do List is Essential:**

We’re all pretty good at adding things to our to-do lists. But what if the real secret to getting more done is doing *less*?

A Not-To-Do List isn’t just about avoiding bad habits. It’s about protecting your focus, energy, and time for the things that actually matter. It’s like decluttering your brain.

Here’s why it works:

### **1. It Protects Your Focus**

Every unnecessary task, meeting, or notification pulls you away from meaningful work. By deciding upfront what you *won’t* do, you stop focus leaks before they happen.

Tim Ferriss says:

> *“What you don’t do determines what you can do.”*

Imagine how much more you could accomplish if you stopped checking your phone every 10 minutes.

### **2. It Reduces Decision Fatigue**

Ever feel exhausted just deciding what to eat for dinner? That’s decision fatigue. And it happens all day long. A Not-To-Do List cuts out unnecessary choices, saving your mental energy for important decisions.

Steve Jobs wore the same outfit every day to avoid wasting mental bandwidth. You don’t need a black turtleneck — just a few “never do this” rules can work wonders.

### **3. It Gives You Permission to Say No**

Saying no is hard. But when it’s written down as a rule, it gets easier. Suddenly, declining that random Meeting invite feels less awkward — you’re just sticking to your Not-To-Do List.

Warren Buffett once said:

> *“The difference between successful people and really successful people is that really successful people say no to almost everything.”*

The more you say no to what doesn’t serve you, the more room you create for what does.



## **3. Real-Life Examples of a Not-To-Do List**

Let’s get practical. A Not-To-Do List works best when it's tailored to your life — but sometimes it helps to see what others are cutting out. Here are a few examples straight from my own list (that drastically changed how I live and work).

### **1. No to News**

A few years ago, I made a bold decision: **I stopped reading the news.**

At first, it felt weird. Almost irresponsible. The world is constantly changing — shouldn’t I stay updated? But over time, I realized that quitting the news didn’t make me ignorant. It made me *free*.

Here’s why.

#### **1. News is Designed to Hijack Your Attention**

Modern news isn't just information. It’s entertainment wrapped in fear. News headlines are designed to grab your attention — usually by making you feel angry, anxious, or shocked. The more you click, the more money they make

Rolf Dobelli, in *The Art of Thinking Clearly*, puts it perfectly:

> *“News is to the mind what sugar is to the body: appetizing, easy to digest — and highly destructive in the long run.”*

The constant stream of negativity distorts your worldview. It makes rare, dramatic events feel like everyday occurrences. And it keeps your brain in a low-level state of stress.

#### **2. News Makes You Dumber (Not Smarter)**

This sounds harsh, but it’s true. News rarely explains anything — it just dumps fragmented facts on you. And accumulating more facts doesn’t actually help you understand the world.

If information alone led to wisdom, journalists would be billionaires with six-pack abs. But that’s not how it works. Real understanding comes from depth, not constant updates.

#### **3. Most News is Irrelevant (or Out of Your Control)**

Think back to the last 100 news articles you read. How many of them actually affected your life? And of those, how many required immediate action?

The truth is, most news is either irrelevant to your day-to-day decisions or completely beyond your influence. Knowing about a political crisis halfway across the world might feel important, but unless you’re in a position to change it, that knowledge just becomes mental clutter.

As Nassim Taleb says:

> *“If news is important, it will find you.”*

When something truly impactful happens, you’ll hear about it — through friends, colleagues, or even a headline you accidentally stumble upon. You don’t need to chase it.

#### **4. The Alternative: Curate What You Consume**

Quitting the news doesn’t mean living in a bubble. It means switching from passive consumption to intentional learning.

Instead of scrolling headlines, I started:

- Reading books and long-form articles for in-depth knowledge.
- Following a few trusted newsletters that summarize key events.
- Listening to long form podcasts that explore topics with nuance (not hype).

I still stay informed — but on my terms, not on a media company’s content treadmill.

#### **The Result: More Peace, More Focus**

Without the constant noise of breaking news, my mind is quieter.I can focus on my goals and feel more in control — because I’m not wasting energy on things I can’t change.

It’s a small shift that made a massive difference. And if the idea of quitting news feels too drastic, try this: **Take a one-week break.** See how it feels. You might not go back.



### **2. No to Non-Productive Meetings**

In the corporate world, Meetings are sneaky time thieves. Especially the ones with no agenda or clear purpose.

Now, I run every meeting invite through a quick mental filter:

- Is the agenda clear?
- Do I need to attend in person, or I can read summary offline? 
- Does the meeting length justify the topic?

If the answers are “no,” I politely decline or ask for async updates. It’s saved me hours each week.

But I get it — not everyone has that luxury. Depending on your role or workplace culture, skipping meetings might not be an option. And that’s okay. The goal isn’t to avoid every meeting; it’s to challenge them a little more.

Tim Ferriss, author of *The 4-Hour Workweek*, suggests this simple rule:

> *“If you want to improve your productivity, start by refusing all meetings without a clear agenda.”*

Even just *asking for an agenda* makes meetings more intentional. Sometimes, just asking those questions makes people rethink if the meeting is even necessary.

So whether you can decline outright or just push for more clarity, every step helps. Your time is valuable — treat it that way.



### **3. No to Phone Notifications**

Having notifications turned on is like handing your attention to random apps. It wrecks focus and keeps you in reactive mode all day.

My rule is simple. From 9am to 7pm:

- **On:** Calls & Texts
- **Off:** Everything else

If something’s truly urgent, people can call. Otherwise, I check apps on my schedule — not whenever they buzz.

### **4. No to Junk Food**

I’m big on fitness, and I realized that eating junk completely messes with my energy, sleep, and mood.

My rule: **Eat natural. Avoid factory-made food.**
 It’s not about perfection, but about stacking the odds in my favor. And honestly, after a while, whole foods taste better anyway.



There are many other in my no-to-do list, but these are top 4, which made the most impact.
 And I strongly believe in Pareto Principle - I do not try to be perfect, but as long as I comply to these above rules 80% of the time, I’m on  the right path.

### **4. How to Build Your Not-To-Do List:**

Ready to make your own Not-To-Do List? It’s easier than you think. The goal isn’t to create a huge list of everything you *shouldn't* do — it’s to spot the few things that constantly drain your energy, waste your time, or pull you off track.

Here’s how to get started:

### **1. Reflect on What Drains You**

Think back over the past few weeks. When did you feel tired, stressed, or frustrated? What tasks or habits drained your energy but didn’t give much back?

Ask yourself:

- What activities leave me mentally drained?
- When do I catch myself procrastinating the most?
- What do I complain about regularly?

### **2. Identify Time & Focus Killers**

Not everything that eats up your time feels bad in the moment. Scrolling social media or binge-watching YouTube can feel relaxing — until you realize you lost two hours.

Be honest with yourself:

- Are there apps you mindlessly check?
- Are you saying yes to things just to avoid conflict?
- Do you overcommit to tasks that aren't even your priority?

The goal isn’t to banish all distractions, but to notice where your time leaks.

### **3. Set Simple, Clear Rules**

Once you’ve spotted the patterns, turn them into clear, actionable rules. They don’t have to be extreme. Even small tweaks make a big difference over time.

For example:

- **Instead of:** "Stop using my phone so much."
- **Try:** "No phone notifications except for calls and texts."

Or:

- **Instead of:** "Stop wasting time in meetings."
- **Try:** "No meetings without a clear agenda."

Simple, specific rules are easier to follow.

### **4. Start Small & Iterate**

You don’t need a perfect list right away. Start with 3–4 rules that feel most impactful. Stick with them for a few weeks, see how you feel, and adjust as needed.

Remember: **This isn’t about perfection.** Even following your Not-To-Do List 80% of the time can massively improve your focus and energy.

As James Clear says:

> *“Every action you take is a vote for the type of person you want to become.”*

Every time you avoid a distraction, you’re casting a vote for a more focused, intentional version of yourself.
