# Notes for my structure for Journal and Plan:

## Current Workflow:

### Daily Journal / Weekly Plan / Annual Plan: 

- Editor : Typora
- Storage Location : Github / Notes folder
- Workflow : A template is kept in the corresponding folder. I duplicate that template, change date to current and edit it.
- Challenges with current workflow:
  - I want to bring everything under PARA Approach I am following. It is currently isolated. 
  - There is no automation. All the steps are manual - duplicate the file, edit the fields and then write. While it is not a big task (takes 30 seconds), it is still a friction. One of my goal for 2025 is to keep things as frictionless as possible.



## New Workflow (2025)

### Daily Journal / Weekly Plan / Annual Plan:

* Editor : Obsidian
* Storage Location : Obsidian Vault / 2 Area / LifeMap
* Cloud : iCloud

**Time: 5-10 min.**

## STEP TWO : CONNECT AND VISUALIZE THE BIG PICTURE

*“The future you see is the future you get.” – Robert G. Allen*

• Take a few minutes to connect to the deeper WHY behind what you are doing each day.
• Write down 3-5 things you appreciate about your current work.
• If there is something that is not in alignment, write down what you would like to see in the future. It's helpful to think about what you DO want versus what you DON'T, and do so with space for opportunities. i.e. I would like to work from home. I want to do something that allows me to be outdoors. Our current frame of reference sometimes only sees a limited amount of opportunities so don't let the 'what' or 'how' stop you. Simply state what you do want.
- Check Annual and Quarterly plan. 

**Time: 2-5 min.**

- [ ] Big Picture Visualization done

## STEP THREE : CELEBRATE LAST WEEK

*“The more you praise and celebrate your life, the more there is in life to celebrate.” ~ Oprah Winfrey*

Write down everything from the past week that you’re proud of. List at least 10 things, and many more if you want. Big or small, anything goes.

**Time: 5-10 min.**
**Good from last week:**

- [wellness]
- [learning]
- ...

## STEP FOUR: ANALYZE WHAT DIDN’T HAPPEN

*“In the end we only regret the chances we didn’t take.” – Lewis Carroll*

• Be honest with yourself
• List the big things that didn’t happen

• Notice why and measure and adjust to see what you can improve for next time.

**Time: 2-5 min.**

**What didn’t Happen: **

* 

## STEP FIVE : CLARIFY AND COMMIT TO YOUR BIGGEST OUTCOMES

*“Focus is the key to the world.” ~ William Dinsmore III*

• Decide on a minimum of 3, maximum of 6-7 outcomes you want to accomplish related to the various areas in your life.
* You want to end each week feeling successful rather than a failure, so pick only a few things that you know you can and will get done… wait for it… that will actually move the needle forward on your area of focus.*
• This could be creating a personal budget, cooking a healthy meal or having a great meeting with a mentor. You get to decide. Just be sure they get you closer to your yearly goals. That’s the key. So “checking Facebook” would not count.
• Keep in mind that the majority of your time should be spent on activities that are in line with your values and that you feel inspired by! If you are enjoying it, and it gets you closer to your goals, it’s a win-win!

**Time: 5-10 min.**

**Top Outcomes:**

- [wellness]

## STEP SIX : SCHEDULE EVERYTHING

*“If you talk about it, it’s a dream, if you envision it, it’s possible, but if you schedule it, it’s real.”  ? Anthony Robbins*

Every task takes time and therefore needs a place on your calendar.

• Look at your 6-7 weekly outcomes and decide what core tasks will need to happen to accomplish these.
• Now spread these out throughout the week.
*Most people can’t accomplish more than 1-3 meaningful things in a day, so that’s your limit.** *

• Pick 1-3 “most important tasks” (MIT’s) related to your outcomes, and schedule them throughout the week:

**Time: 5-15 min.**



## Note to Self : IMPORTANT THINGS TO KEEP IN MIND

1.    **Everything takes longer than we think.**  If you think it’s going   to take an hour to write an article, then schedule an hour and a half. Your worst case scenario is ending up having free time.
2.    **Leave windows of “buffer time”.**  Do not fill in every second of every day. Unexpected things will always come up. Don’t let them snowplough your week. Give yourself time to take care of last-minute stuff that matters, and to be spontaneous with things.
3.    **Know you won’t get it all done.**  Even with great planning, it seems like we tend to be over ambitious. Be okay with leaving something for next week. It gives you something to look forward to anyway.
4.    **Schedule the most important things early in the day and early in the week. **Given the above, front-weight your most important tasks so that no matter what comes up, at least a few of them will get done.
