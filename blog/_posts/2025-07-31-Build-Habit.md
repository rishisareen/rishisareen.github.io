## **Part 2: How to Build Better Habits (Without Burning Out)**

Last time, we talked about how so much of our life runs on autopilot, guided by habits we don’t even realize we have.
The question now is: **how do we take back the steering wheel?**
How can we use the brain’s natural love for efficiency to build habits that *actually* serve us?

Let’s get into it.

### **The Scripts We Follow Without Realizing**

Ever walked into a local restaurant, waited to be seated, ordered Dal Makhni, Shahi Paneer without looking at the menu and barely noticed how automatic it felt?

That’s not just habit. That’s what psychologists call a **cognitive script**.

**Cognitive Script Theory** says we carry mental “scripts” for how common situations play out.

Like how to greet elders with “Namaste,” or how to stand in line at a temple. These scripts are shaped by past experiences and culture, so we can respond quickly without overthinking.

They’re incredibly helpful.
 But here’s where it gets interesting: **we don’t just have scripts for tasks, we have them for emotions and behavior, too.**

- If someone scolds you in public, your brain might automatically run the *defend yourself script* or *stay quiet and nod script*
- If you're bored, it might cue up the *scroll your phone script*.
- If you're anxious about results, it could be the *pray and wait script* or *scroll Instagram script*.

These responses feel instant, even natural. But often, they’re just **well-rehearsed routines** played out so many times they feel like “just the way I am.”

### **Why This Matters for Habit Change**

If you want to change a habit, you're not just changing a single action. You’re editing the whole script behind it.

And editing starts with **awareness**.

Ask yourself:

- What’s the situation I’m in?
- What script does my brain usually run here?
- Is that script helping me, or just a leftover loop?

The moment you notice the script is the moment you get a choice.
 You don’t have to run it again. You can pause. You can try a different line.
 **And with practice, you can rewrite the whole story.**

### **Why New Habits Often Fail**

Let’s be honest. Most people don’t fail to build habits because they’re lazy.
 They fail because they try to rely on willpower. And willpower is like a battery, it drains fast.

Here’s what usually happens:

- We set a big goal (“I’ll wake up at 5am, do yoga, and finish my walk before sunrise!”)
- We get two days in, feel exhausted, miss a day, and then give up.
- The brain goes, “That felt hard. Let’s not do that again.”

Sound familiar?

The problem isn’t you, it’s the **system**.

Good habits don’t stick because of motivation. They stick because of **design**.

### **Designing Habits That Stick: 4 Science Backed Tips**

Here are four powerful, proven strategies to help habits take root:

------

#### **1. Make it obvious**

The easier your brain can spot the *cue*, the more likely the habit will happen.

- Want to drink more water? Keep a copper bottle on your desk.
- Want to take supplements? Place them next to your filter or lunch dabba.
- Want to walk in the morning? Set your shoes by the door the night before.

You’re not “trying harder.” You’re making it hard to miss.

#### **2. Make it tiny**

Big changes feel exciting. But tiny ones are more sustainable.

Instead of: “I’ll meditate for 30 minutes,”
 Try: **“I’ll sit quietly for one minute after I brush my teeth.”**

That’s not lazinessz, it’s smart. Small habits build momentum. They’re easier to repeat. And repetition is what rewires the brain.

------

#### **3. Anchor it to something you already do**

This is called **habit stacking**, and it’s gold.

Pair your new habit with an existing one:

- “After I drink my morning chai, I’ll step outside and feel the sun for 30 seconds.”
- “After I shut my laptop, I’ll stretch for 30 seconds.”

You’re using the rhythm of your existing day to piggyback a new habit on top.

------

#### **4. Make it rewarding**

The brain loves a win. So make sure your habit *feels* good right away.

That could mean checking it off a list, enjoying how calm you feel, or just saying, “Shabaash, well done” to yourself.
 If the reward is delayed or vague, the habit won’t feel worth it.

Remember: your brain doesn’t care about long-term goals as much as it cares about short-term rewards.

------

### **What About Breaking Bad Habits?**

Here’s the twist: you can’t just delete a habit. You have to *replace* it.

Let’s say you scroll your phone every night in bed.
 You can’t just say “I’ll stop doing that.” Your brain still wants the cue (winding down) and the reward (relaxation).
 So swap the *action*: maybe with reading a few pages of fiction or listening to soft music.

It’s not about fighting your brain. It’s about working *with* it.

### **One Last Thought**

We often think of habits as boring. But here’s the truth:
 **Habits are how we become who we want to be.**

It’s not about one big breakthrough. It’s about small steps repeated over time.

You don’t have to overhaul your life.
 Just pick one habit. Start tiny. Make it easy. And keep going, even if you miss a day.

That’s how change really happens.

Not overnight.
But one quiet, automatic choice at a time.
