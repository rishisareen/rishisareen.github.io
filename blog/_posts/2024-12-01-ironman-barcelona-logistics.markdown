Ironman Barcelona race is held in Calella, a costal town around 60km north of Barcelona City

This blog post is capturing my notes from 2024, on travel from the city and stay recommendations



# Travel:

Barcelona Airport (El Prat) is the main gateway for athletes arriving for Ironman Barcelona.

There are two main terminals - Terminal 1 and Terminal 2. Most of the international flights arrive on Terminal 1. 

Both bus and train are available from Barcelona Airport to Calella. 

Chose the transport option depending on where you are staying in Calella. 

* **Calella Bus Stop** - [Sant Jaume](https://maps.app.goo.gl/9h32HorF85nVRATg9) (Also called as Oficina de Turisme de Calella)
  * This is closer to all the hotels and Ironman Expo. Most of pre-race activities will happen here.

* **Calella Train Stop** - [Estación de tren Calella](https://maps.app.goo.gl/2hLpkGzHyzAE22sK6)
  * This is closer to T1 and T2. So bike will be stored in this area. 

**Note:** Calella is a small town. Bus Stop and Train station are just 1.5km away. 



### Bus

This is the option I preferred on arrival as there was direct bus from both T1 and T2 to Calella. 

* The company **Sagales** operates direct bus from Barcelona Airport to Calella (Bus number 603/618)
* You can check schedule and book ticket online from their [website](https://www.sagales.com/sale/?id_origen=610&id_desti=631&sgLang=en). Just show QR code on your phone and board the bus. This is what I did.
  * Origin : Airport T1 or Airport T2 - depending on your airline arrival terminal. If T1, the bus is available from platform 10-11-12. All this can be confirmed by their website when you fill the origin part.
  * For destination, select "Calella, Sant Jaume - Oficina d'Informacio"
* Alternatively, ticket can also be bought at the bus itself. But remember to carry cash if this is your preferred option. As of 2024, ticket price was 10.65€
* Remember to buy one extra ticket for your bike bag. They have plenty of space for bike. When I took the bus, there were 8 bike bags on the bus.
* **Note:** 2024 schedule can be found [here](https://www.sagales.com/uploads/imagenes/31892b89c54ec37dc2de7cd212ac9fe4c8c76010.pdf) 



### Train

Another good option. I used this on the return journey. 

Steps:

* **Take the R2 Nord Line** from Barcelona Airport to Barcelona Sants (or Passeig de Gràcia).
* At Sants or Passeig de Gràcia, switch to the **R1 Line (Rodalies)** heading towards Blanes or Maçanet-Massanes.
* Get off at **Calella Station**.



### Taxi

Good option if you're a larger group. Taxis are easily available. Expect to pay 100-130€



### Car Rental

* Great option if you're comfortable driving in Europe and have plans to roam around post race too.
* After the race was over, I rented a car from company SixT. I find them most value for money.
* Rental cars are easily available in Airport. Book online in advance for best rates (same day rate are usually 10% higher)



# Stay

As Calella is a beach town, there are many stay options. Most of the hotels are prepared to host Ironman athletes and some even have packages for athletes, which also include early morning breakfast on the race day.

For stay option, consider where you'll spend most of the time. In 2024, all activities were around [this area](https://maps.app.goo.gl/RbU27ZBJiMKxSbBY7)

For 2024 reference, 

* See this [Google Map](https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/viewer?mid=1TH3XkOIMNwhOpaHXV1uTYMOvQB29Rys&ll=41.60932619380188%2C2.6504802762474666&z=19) for all the important areas
* See the [Athlete Guide](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-xo0iwtfNZSj7l-j3higDdaHYsIMyRMI/view?usp=sharing) for the details 



I hope this helps. Have a great race!
