This is my digital garden - a collection of notes, ideas, and thoughts that I'm cultivating over time.

## What's Here

Unlike polished articles, these notes are:

- **Work in progress** - constantly evolving
- **Interconnected** - ideas link to each other
- **Personal** - my own understanding, not universal truths

## How to Navigate

Browse the folders on the left to explore different topics:

- **Productivity** - systems, habits, routines
- **Fitness** - training, recovery, performance
- **Books** - reading notes and key takeaways

## Philosophy

> "A garden is never finished. It's a living thing that grows and changes."

Feel free to explore. Some notes are seeds, others are fully grown.
