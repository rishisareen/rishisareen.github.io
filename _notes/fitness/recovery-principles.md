Recovery is where adaptation happens.

## The Big Three

1. **Sleep** - 7-9 hours, consistent schedule
2. **Nutrition** - protein, carbs, hydration
3. **Stress management** - training is stress too

## Active Recovery

- Easy walks
- Light swimming
- Mobility work
- Foam rolling

## Signs of Poor Recovery

- Elevated resting heart rate
- Poor sleep quality
- Decreased motivation
- Lingering fatigue
