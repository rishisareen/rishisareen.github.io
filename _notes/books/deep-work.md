Cal Newport's guide to focused success.

## Definition

Deep Work: Professional activities performed in a state of distraction-free concentration that push your cognitive capabilities to their limit.

## Key Strategies

- **Time blocking** - schedule deep work sessions
- **Ritualize** - same time, same place
- **Embrace boredom** - train your focus muscle
- **Quit social media** - or drastically limit it

## Deep Work Philosophies

1. Monastic - eliminate all distractions
2. Bimodal - alternate between deep and shallow
3. Rhythmic - daily habit at set times
4. Journalistic - fit it in when you can
