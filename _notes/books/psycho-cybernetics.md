## Summary
Imagine your brain is a super-advanced computer designed for one specific purpose : to help you succeed. Psycho-Cybernetics is a user manual for that computer.

* Psycho : The mind
* Cybernetics : A Greek word meaning "steersman" (someone who steers a ship)

So, Psycho-Cybernetics basically means "**Steering your mind to a productive target**"

This book digs into the power of self image, the power of sub-conscious mind and how to use it to pursue your goals. 

Dr. Maxwell Maltz, the man who created Psycho-Cybernetics, discovered a "glitch" in the human brain that you can use as a superpower:

> **Your nervous system cannot tell the difference between a real experience and one that is vividly imagined.**

The book focuses on power of self-image, how can you improve it so you can set a big goal. Once goal is set, how one can harness the power of imagination to progress towards your goal. 

It is a very practical book, digging to great examples from hyposis to top athletes using visualization to lay down the path towards goal. Lot of future famous work : Tony Robbins to Sports Visualization was influenced by this book. I wish the name was not that scary / daunting (the name doesnt tell clearly what the book is about).

> 'Before the mind can work efficiently, we must develop our perception of the outcomes we expect to reach. Maxwell Maltz calls this Psycho-Cybernetics; when the mind has a defined target it can focus and direct and refocus and redirect until it reaches its intended goal :  Tony Robbins, author of Unlimited Power and Awaken the Giant Within

I plan to use this book to chase my two goals : Hyrox and Finance. That is a separate post. Will use these notes to summarize chapter by chapter as I progress through it. 



## My Notes
### 1. **Chapter 1 : Self Image**

* This chapter starts from the basics : we all have self image, many of our acts are consistent with our self image. And, the loophole is, we can change our self image. In fact, it is literally impossible to really think positively about a particular situation as long as you hold a negative concept of your “self.”

* > The new science of cybernetics has furnished us with convincing proof that the so-called subconscious mind is not a “mind” at all, but a mechanism—a goal-striving “servo-mechanism” consisting of the brain and nervous system, which is used by, and directed by the mind. The latest and most usable concept is that man does not have two “minds,” but a mind, or consciousness, that operates an automatic, goal-striving machine. This automatic, goal-striving machine functions very similarly to the way that electronic servo-mechanisms function, as far as basic principles are concerned. But it is much more marvelous, much more complex, than any computer or guided missile ever conceived by man.

* > Dr. Maltz makes it clear that all of us have goals, whether we intentionally articulate them or not. The brain and nervous system are continually leading us in the direction of images we think about consciously, or images that are so much a part of us that we’re led toward them on autopilot. The alcoholic or drug addict has goals just as much as the entrepreneur, politician, professional athlete, or mother-to-be. With this in mind, we can become aware of what’s “under the hood”—and whether or not we want the goals we’re unconsciously moving toward, or the ones that we consciously choose and work toward.

* Like any other servo-mechanism, it must have a clear-cut goal, objective, or “problem” to work on. 

* The goals that our own Creative Mechanism seeks to achieve are mental images, or mental pictures, which we create by the use of imagination. The key goal-image is our self-image. **Our self-image prescribes the limits for the accomplishment of any particular goals. It prescribes the “area of the possible.”** <u>Hence, everything starts with self image. And that is why visualization is so powerful</u> 

* Dr Maltz says the method itself is simple. It consists of learning, practising and experiencing new habits of thinking, imagining, remembering, and acting in order to  

  * develop an adequate and realistic self-image, and 
  * use your Creative Mechanism to bring success and happiness in achieving particular goals.

* Basically success will feed on success. Your improved self image will make bigger goals believable and the belief will help to achieve them. 

### 2. Chapter 2 : Discovering the success mechanism within you

* Focus of this chapter is humans have evolved to have success mechanism that goes beyond survival needs. 

  *  For an animal “to live” simply means that certain physical needs must be met. Animals cannot select their goals. Their goals (self-preservation and procreation) are preset, so to speak. And their success mechanism is limited to these built-in goal-images, which we call “instincts.” 
  * Man, on the other hand, has something animals don’t: Creative Imagination. Thus man of all creatures is more than a creature, he is also a creator. With his imagination he can formulate a variety of goals. Man alone can direct his Success Mechanism by the use of imagination, or imaging ability.
* Various examples are given how when are learning, everything is an effort (like child learning to hold a pencil and write). But once we learn, it goes into subsconscious so that our mental energy is saved for future learning. And this 
* **Once you decide on a goal, your subconscious works in background to make choices towards your goal.**
* **The basic principles**:
  1. Your built-in Success Mechanism must have a goal or “target.” This goal, or target, must be conceived of as “already in existence—now” either in actual or potential form. It operates by either (1) steering you to a goal already in existence or (2) “discovering” something already in existence. 
  1. The automatic mechanism is teleological, that is, it operates or must be oriented to “end results” goals. Do not be discouraged because the “means whereby” may not be apparent. It is the function of the automatic mechanism to supply the means whereby when you supply the goal. Think in terms of the end result, and the means whereby will often take care of themselves. 
  1.  Do not be afraid of making mistakes, or of temporary failures. All servo-mechanisms achieve a goal by negative feedback, or by going forward, making mistakes, and immediately correcting course. 
  1.  Skill learning of any kind is accomplished by trial and error, mentally correcting aim after an error, until a “successful” motion, movement, or performance has been achieved. After that, further learning, and continued success, is accomplished by forgetting the past errors, and remembering the successful response, so that it can be imitated. 
  1.  You must learn to trust your Creative Mechanism to do its work and not “jam it” by becoming too concerned or too anxious as to whether it will work or not, or by attempting to force it by too much conscious effort. You must “let it” work, rather than “make it” work. This trust is necessary because your Creative Mechanism operates below the level of consciousness, and you cannot “know” what is going on beneath the surface. Moreover, its nature is to operate spontaneously according to present need. Therefore, you have no guarantees in advance. It comes into operation as you act and as you place a demand on it by your actions. You must not wait to act until you have proof—you must act as if it is there, and it will come through. “Do the thing and you will have the power,” said Emerson.
  

### 3. Imagination : The First Key to Your Success Mechanism

* Previous chapters covered that mind is powerful and self image is the key to everything. And once you set a goal, your mind works on achieving it in background. 

* This chapter digs into fact that Your nervous system cannot tell the difference between an imagined experience and a real experience. In either case, it reacts automatically to information that you give to it from your forebrain. The brain and nervous system that react automatically to the environment are the same brain and nervous system that tell us what the environment is.

  > For example, if a good hypnotic subject is told that he is at the North Pole, he will not only shiver and appear to be cold, his body will react just as if he were cold and goose pimples will develop. The same phenomenon has been demonstrated on wide-awake college students by asking them to imagine that one of their hands is immersed in ice water. Thermometer readings show that the temperature does drop in the “treated” hand. Tell a hypnotized subject that your finger is a red hot poker, and he will not only grimace with pain at your touch, but his cardiovascular and lymphatic systems will react just as if your finger were a red hot poker and produce inflammation and perhaps a blister on the skin.
    >


* You act, and feel, not according to what things are really like, but according to the image your mind holds of what they are like. You have certain mental images of yourself, your world, and the people around you, and you behave as though these images were the truth, the reality, rather than the things they represent.

* So, how to use this knowledge? This para summarize this well

  > As Alex Morrison said, you must first clearly see a thing in your mind before you can do it. When you do see a thing clearly in your mind, the creative Success Mechanism within you takes over and does the job much better than you could do it by conscious effort, or “willpower.” 
  >
  > Instead of trying hard by conscious effort to do the thing with ironed-jawed willpower, and all the while worrying and picturing to yourself all the things that are likely to go wrong, you simply relax the strain, stop trying to do it by strain and effort, picture to yourself the target you really want to hit, and let your creative Success Mechanism take over. 
  >
  > Thus, mentally picturing the desired end result literally forces you to use “positive thinking.” You are not relieved thereafter from effort and work, but your efforts are used to carry you forward toward your goal, rather than in the futile mental conflict that results when you want and try to do one thing, but picture to yourself something else.

* This chapter gives a practice exercise to visualize the goal everyday. It recommends 30 min each day but say you can have good results even with 10 or 15 min. 

  * **Create a Daily Habit:** Set aside 30 minutes each day (or start with 5–10 minutes) to be alone, relax, and close your eyes to exercise your imagination.
  * **The "Motion Picture" Technique:** Imagine you are sitting before a large movie screen watching yourself act exactly the way you want to be : confident, calm, and successful.
  * **Importance of Detail:** For the technique to work, the images must be vivid. You must imagine small details like specific sounds, smells, and tactile sensations so your nervous system mistakes the imagination for a real experience.
  * **Automatic Success:** This practice builds new "memories" in your mid-brain. Eventually, you will find yourself acting differently in real life "automatically and spontaneously," without having to "try" hard.
  * **Overcoming Difficulty:** If your mind wanders or you struggle to visualize, first relax your body (try "smiling" into your body) and recall a past success to trigger a positive feeling. Then, carry that feeling into your current visualization.

  

### 4. Dehypnotize Yourself from False Beliefs

* This chapter digs into self-image and how we have "hypnotized" ourselves into beliefs as if they are true. Beliefs are not physical laws and it can be changed.

* Author gives many example of how people perform various feats when hypnotized. The key takeaway: "When the hypnotist has guided the subject to the point where he is convinced that the hypnotist’s words are true statements, the subject then behaves differently because he thinks and believes differently.”

> To onlookers, the hypnotist’s “word” has a magical power. Such, however, is not the case. The power, the basic ability, to do these things was inherent in the subjects all the time—even before they met the hypnotist. The subjects, however, were unable to use this power because they themselves did not know it was there. They had bottled it up, and choked it off, because of their own negative beliefs. Without realizing it, they had hypnotized themselves into believing they could not do these things. And it would be truer to say that the hypnotist had “dehypnotized” them than to say he had hypnotized them.

* He digs deeper into this thought and why we feel inferior

> It is not knowledge of actual inferiority in skill or knowledge that gives us an inferiority complex and interferes with our living. It is the feeling of inferiority that does this. And this feeling of inferiority comes about for just one reason: We judge ourselves, and measure ourselves, not against our own “norm” or “par” but against some other individual’s “norm.” When we do this, we always, without exception, come out second best. But because we think and believe and assume that we should measure up to some other person’s “norm,” we feel miserable, and second-rate, and conclude that there is something wrong with us. The next logical conclusion in this cockeyed reasoning process is to conclude that we are not “worthy”; that we do not deserve success and happiness, and that it would be out of place for us to fully express our own abilities and talents, whatever they might be, without apology, or without feeling guilty about it.

* Now we tie this feeling of inferiority and superiority together
> The person with an inferiority complex invariably compounds the error by striving for superiority. His feelings spring from the false premise that he is inferior. From this false premise, a whole structure of “logical thought” and feeling is built. If he feels bad because he is inferior, the cure is to make himself as good as everybody else, and the way to feel really good is to make himself superior. This striving for superiority gets him into more trouble, causes more frustration, and sometimes brings about a neurosis where none existed before. He becomes more miserable than ever, and “the harder he tries,” the more miserable he becomes. Inferiority and superiority are reverse sides of the same coin. The cure lies in realizing that the coin itself is spurious.

* And the core point

> The truth about you is this: 
>
> You are not “inferior.” 
>
> You are not “superior.”
>
>  **You are simply “You.”** 
>
> “You” as a personality are not in competition with any other personality simply because there is not another person on the face of the earth like you, or in your particular class. You are an individual. You are unique. You are not “like” any other person and can never become “like” any other person. You are not “supposed” to be like any other person and no other person is “supposed” to be like you.

* Interestingly, this inferiority complex is manufactured in lab
> An “inferiority complex,” and its accompanying deterioration in performance, can be made to order in the psychological laboratory. All you need to do is to set up a norm or average, then convince your subject he does not measure up. According to a report in Science Digest, a psychologist wanted to find out how feelings of inferiority affected ability to solve problems. He gave his students a set of routine tests. But then he solemnly announced that the average person could complete the test in about one-fifth the time it would really take. When in the course of the test a bell would ring, indicating that the “average man’s” time was up, some of the brightest subjects became very jittery and incompetent indeed, thinking themselves to be morons. Stop measuring yourself against “their” standards. **You are not “them” and can never measure up. Neither can “they” measure up to yours—nor should they. Once you see this simple, rather self-evident truth, accept it, and believe it, your inferior feelings will vanish.**

* He finishes the chapter by prescribing daily relaxation habits. His recommendation is it helps to visualize new "you" (one without inferior beliefs) when you are relaxed. Not sure how much I agree on this, but everyone advocates daily relaxation.
