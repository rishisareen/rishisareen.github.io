## Summary
This book is about 100-baggers. It is study of stocks that returns $100 for every $1 invested. 

This is a well structured book ; divided into two parts. In first part, Christopher gives stories and examples of companies which achieved 100 baggers. Then he goes into analysis of what is common between these companies and what we can learn from it and refine our search for 100 baggers with this approach. 

I loved the book ; it is clearly written, full of real-world examples and logical breakdown of common themes between the 100 baggers stocks. 


## My Notes
### **Chapter 1 : Introducing 100-Baggers**

* He introduces us to the famous book "100 to 1 in the stock market" by Thomas Phelps, where the original study of 100 baggers was done.  Some of the key notes mentioned from that book:

> Along the way, Phelps figured out a few things about investing. He conducted a fascinating study on stocks that returned $100 for every $1  invested. Yes, 100 to 1. Phelps found hundreds of such stocks, bunches  available in any single year, that you could have bought and enjoyed a  100-to-1 return on—if you had just held on. 
>
> This was the main thrust of our conversation: the key is not only finding  them, but keeping them. His basic conclusion can be summed up in the  phrase “buy right and hold on.”  “Let’s face it,” he said: “a great deal of investing is on par with the instinct  that makes a fish bite on an edible spinner because it is moving.” Investors  too bite on what’s moving and can’t sit on a stock that isn’t going anywhere.  They also lose patience with one that is moving against them. This causes  them to make a lot of trades and never enjoy truly mammoth returns.  Investors crave activity, and Wall Street is built on it. The media feeds  it all, making it seem as if important things happen every day. Hundreds  of millions of shares change hands every session. 

> Phelps showed me a little table that reveals how much and for how  long a stock must compound its value to multiply a hundredfold:

> Phelps advises looking for new methods, new materials and new products—things that improve life, that solve problems and allow us to do  things better, faster and cheaper.

> Phelps is quick to add he is not advocating blindly holding onto stocks.  “My advice to buy right and hold on is intended to counter unproductive activity,” he said, “not to recommend putting them away and forgetting them.” 

* The last quote is a brilliant point. While holding is great, it is important to monitor this. In later chapter, Christopher also remarks that ideally he holds the stock for as long as ROE is growing, unless valuation (P/E) becomes outrageous. 
* Christopher concludes this chapter with a lovely remark : "Investing is, arguably, more art than science,  anyway. If investing well were all about statistics, then the best investors  would be statisticians. And that is not the case.  We’re looking for insights and wisdom, not hard laws and proofs. 

### Chapter 2 : Anybody can do this : True Stories
* Short chapter ; stories of people who did 100 bagger

### Chapter 3 : The coffee can portfolio

* As the name suggests, this chapter brings out the concept of Coffee can portfolio, which is covered to a great extent by another brilliant book "The Coffee Can Investing" by Saurabh Mukherjea.

* The idea is simple: you find the best stocks you can and let them sit  for 10 years. You don't put anything in your coffee can you don't think is a good 10-year bet. 

* 10-year is a good time. Atleast analyzing and pruning the stocks. While to get a 100 baggers, you have to let it go, you also have to embrace the reality that world s changing rapidly. The survival rate is low. 

  * For example, take a look at the average lifespan  of a firm in the S&P 500 index. It is now less than 20 years. In 1958, it was 61 years. 

  * In indian context, **Of the original 30 companies that made up the SENSEX in 1986 (base year 1979), **only 7 remain** in the index today.

  * In the last 10 years alone, the SENSEX has seen a churn rate of roughly **50%**. This means that if you look at the index today, half of these companies likely won't be there in 2036.

* Moral : Coffee can is a good approach as it eliminates short term action / activity. But it is not "buy-and-forget", re-visit periodically. 



### Chapter 4 : Study of 100-Baggers

* A fellow named Tony at TS Analysis published one informal 15-page study  called “An Analysis of 100-Baggers.”. Main takeaways he presented:

1. The most powerful stock moves tended to be during extended  periods of growing earnings accompanied by an expansion of  the P/E ratio.  
2. These periods of P/E expansion often seem to coincide with  periods of accelerating earnings growth.  
3. Some of the most attractive opportunities occur in beaten-down,  forgotten stocks, which perhaps after years of losses are returning  to profitability. 
4.  During such periods of rapid share price appreciation, stock prices  can reach lofty P/E ratios. This shouldn’t necessarily deter one  from continuing to hold the stock. 

* **Main Takeaway: Growth, Growth and more growth are what power these movers**

* Indian stock study also done with Motilal Oswal (to be written in separate article, these guys have brilliant analysis on their website). Their main summary for 100 baggers:

> But there are other ingredients as well. “Our analysis of the 100x  stocks suggests that their essence lies in the alchemy of five elements  forming the acronym SQGLP,” they wrote:  
>
> *  S—Size is small.  
> * Q—Quality is high for both business and management. 
> * G—Growth in earnings is high. 
> * L—Longevity in both Q and G  
> * P—Price is favorable for good returns.  
>
> Most of these are fairly objective, save for assessing management.  “In the ultimate analysis, it is the management alone which is the 100x  alchemist,” they concluded. “And it is to those who have mastered the art  of evaluating the alchemist that the stock market rewards with gold.” 

* Importance of Management is something that comes up in future chapters too.



### Chapter 5 : The 100 Baggers of the last 50 years

* To get 100 Baggers,  you need growth —and lots of it. Ideally, you need it in both the size of the business and in the  multiple the market puts on the stock, as we’ve seen—the twin engines,  as author call them. 

>  Despite occasional exceptions, you do want to focus on companies  that have national or international markets.

* From case study of Monster beverage, one key summary (and metrics to watch out for)

> 1. Net sales grew to a larger percentage of gross sales. That reflects promotions (discounts) Monster no longer needed to  offer, as Monster was now a well-known brand retailers wanted  to carry.  
> 1. Gross profits as a percentage of net sales also increased as their  copackers and distribution partners started to see them as a  good customer and offer concessions to stay.

* In another analysis for Jeff Bezos / Amazon study, the analyst mentions 

> “At heart, he understands two things,” Thompson writes. “He understands the value of a business is the sum of its future free cash flows, discounted back to the present. And he understands capital allocation and  the importance of return on invested capital.” 
>
> From Bezos’s 1999 shareholder letter: “Each of the previous  goals I’ve outlined contribute to our long-standing objective  of building the best, most profitable, highest return on capital,  long-term franchise.”  
>
> From Bezos’s first shareholder letter, in 1997: “Market leadership can translate directly to higher revenue, higher profitability, greater capital velocity and correspondingly stronger returns on  invested capital. Our decisions have consistently reflected this focus.” 

* In case of Amazon, if one is analyzing stock, we need to add back CAPEX to arrive at the correct picture. Prof Aswath Damodaran also talks about this.

> “Looking at Amazon’s reported operating income, it doesn’t look  profitable,” Thompson continues. “On $88 billion in 2014 sales, Amazon  earned a measly $178 million in operating income. That’s a razor-thin  0.20% operating margin.  
>
> “Adding back R&D, however, paints a completely different picture. In  2014, Amazon spent $9.2 billion on R&D. Adding that back to operating  income, Amazon generated adjusted operating income of $9.4 billion in  2014. **That’s an operating margin of 10.6%.** 

* Great study examples from Monster Beverages, Amazon, EA Sports, Comcast, Pepsi, Gilette. The author ends chapter with note from "One Up on the Wall Street" by Peter Lynch on the Importance of growth:

> **All else being equal, a 20 percent grower selling at 20 times earnings (a p/e of 20) is a much better buy than a 10 percent grower  selling at 10 times earnings (a p/e of 10). This may sound like an  esoteric point, but it’s important to understand what happens to  the earnings of the faster growers that propel the stock price.**

### Chapter 6 : The Key to 100 Baggers

* This is transition chapter from examples so far to now going to nitty gritty of characterstick of a 100 bagger stock.
* *“If a company has a high ROE for four or five years in a row—and  earned it not with leverage but from high profit margins—that’s a great  place to start,”. “So  when you see a company that has an ROE of 20 percent year after year,  somebody is taking the profit at the end of the year and recycling back in  the business so that ROE can stay right where it is.”* 



### Chapter 7 : Owner - Operators : Skin in the game

> So you have a situation where the stock is expensive and insiders are  selling but ETFs are mindlessly buying more. There were other property  companies owned by insiders that traded for half (or less) the valuation  of Simon with twice the yield. “But because there’s not a lot of ‘free float,’  they’re being neglected,” Doyle said. “Those are the types of securities  that we’re looking at and trying to include in most of our funds.”  

* This chapter opens with a powerful point. One of the big contributors of stock moving up is Mutual Fund and ETF buying into it. But if a stock is owned largely by owners, the float (stock available in market to trade) would be less. So, less funds will go for it as they want to aquire a sizeable chunk. So the stock price will not be as appreciated or atleast not as quickly compared to other stocks which are more liquid. 
  * **The Math:** If a fund manages $10 Billion, a 1% position is $100 Million. If a company has a low "free float" (few shares actually trading), trying to buy $100M worth of stock would send the price skyrocketing before the fund could finish filling its order.
  * **The Exit Problem:** Funds worry more about *selling* than buying. If they own 10% of the free float, they cannot exit the position quickly without crashing the stock.
  * **Result:** They simply ignore these stocks. They *must* buy liquid, high-float giants even if they are expensive, because they can get in and out easily.
  * If the stock has low float, it often gets excluded by Index (Nasdaq, BSE, NSE) . As the indexes calculates the market value by excluding the owner stocks. So, it also gets excluded from various ETF which are often passive funds and rule based (invest if it is in index)
* After this interesting insight, Christopher focuses that Owner operated after often high value, as they are owners so they take long term decision and also need not answer to the market in the short term

### Chapter 8 : The Outsiders : The Best CEOs

> The main idea is that these CEOs were all great capital allocators, or  great investors. Capital allocation equals investment. And CEOs have five  basic options, says Thorndike: invest in existing operations, acquire other  businesses, pay dividends, pay down debt or buy back stock.

* This chapter presents research from the book "The Outsiders : Eight Unconventional  CEO and their radically rational blueprint for success". In the book, 8 successful CEO are analyzed (Including Jack Welsh and Warren Buffet). Thorndike writes each CEO understood that
  * capital allocation is the CEO’s most important job;  
  * value per share is what counts, not overall size or growth;  
  * Long term value is determined by cash flows not reported earnings
  * decentralized organizations release entrepreneurial energies;  
  * independent thinking is essential to long-term success;  
  * sometimes the best opportunity is holding your own stock; and  
  * patience is a virtue with acquisitions, as is occasional boldness. 
* The chapter also goes into next candidates for such multi baggers. But this book is from 2015, and 10 years is a long time. So I would rather run my own research based on the principles. 




## Favorite Quotes
* “Every human problem is an investment opportunity if you can anticipate  the solution,” the old gentleman told me. “Except for thieves, who would  buy locks?” 

* Investing is, arguably, more art than science,  anyway. If investing well were all about statistics, then the best investors  would be statisticians. And that is not the case.  We’re looking for insights and wisdom, not hard laws and proofs.
