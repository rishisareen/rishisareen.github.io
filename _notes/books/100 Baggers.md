## Summary
This book is about 100-baggers. It is study of stocks that returns $100 for every $1 invested. 

This is a well structured book ; divided into two parts. In first part, Christopher gives stories and examples of companies which achieved 100 baggers. Then he goes into analysis of what is common between these companies and what we can learn from it and refine our search for 100 baggers with this approach. 

I loved the book ; it is clearly written, full of real-world examples and logical breakdown of common themes between the 100 baggers stocks. 



## My Notes
### 1. **Chapter 1 : Introducing 100-Baggers**

* He introduces us to the famous book "100 to 1 in the stock market" by Thomas Phelps, where the original study of 100 baggers was done.  Some of the key notes mentioned from that book:

> Along the way, Phelps figured out a few things about investing. He conducted a fascinating study on stocks that returned $100 for every $1  invested. Yes, 100 to 1. Phelps found hundreds of such stocks, bunches  available in any single year, that you could have bought and enjoyed a  100-to-1 return on—if you had just held on. 
>
> This was the main thrust of our conversation: the key is not only finding  them, but keeping them. His basic conclusion can be summed up in the  phrase “buy right and hold on.”  “Let’s face it,” he said: “a great deal of investing is on par with the instinct  that makes a fish bite on an edible spinner because it is moving.” Investors  too bite on what’s moving and can’t sit on a stock that isn’t going anywhere.  They also lose patience with one that is moving against them. This causes  them to make a lot of trades and never enjoy truly mammoth returns.  Investors crave activity, and Wall Street is built on it. The media feeds  it all, making it seem as if important things happen every day. Hundreds  of millions of shares change hands every session. 

> Phelps showed me a little table that reveals how much and for how  long a stock must compound its value to multiply a hundredfold:

> Phelps advises looking for new methods, new materials and new products—things that improve life, that solve problems and allow us to do  things better, faster and cheaper.

> Phelps is quick to add he is not advocating blindly holding onto stocks.  “My advice to buy right and hold on is intended to counter unproductive activity,” he said, “not to recommend putting them away and forgetting them.” 

* The last quote is a brilliant point. While holding is great, it is important to monitor this. In later chapter, Christopher also remarks that ideally he holds the stock for as long as ROE is growing, unless valuation (P/E) becomes outrageous. 

* Christopher concludes this chapter with a lovely remark : "Investing is, arguably, more art than science,  anyway. If investing well were all about statistics, then the best investors  would be statisticians. And that is not the case.  We’re looking for insights and wisdom, not hard laws and proofs. 

  




## Favorite Quotes
* “Every human problem is an investment opportunity if you can anticipate  the solution,” the old gentleman told me. “Except for thieves, who would  buy locks?” 

* Investing is, arguably, more art than science,  anyway. If investing well were all about statistics, then the best investors  would be statisticians. And that is not the case.  We’re looking for insights and wisdom, not hard laws and proofs.
