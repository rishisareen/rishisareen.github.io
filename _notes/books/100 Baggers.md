## Summary
This book is about 100-baggers. It is study of stocks that returns $100 for every $1 invested. 

This is a well structured book ; divided into two parts. In first part, Christopher gives stories and examples of companies which achieved 100 baggers. Then he goes into analysis of what is common between these companies and what we can learn from it and refine our search for 100 baggers with this approach. 

I loved the book ; it is clearly written, full of real-world examples and logical breakdown of common themes between the 100 baggers stocks. 


## My Notes
### 1. **Chapter 1 : Introducing 100-Baggers**

* He introduces us to the famous book "100 to 1 in the stock market" by Thomas Phelps, where the original study of 100 baggers was done.  Some of the key notes mentioned from that book:

> Along the way, Phelps figured out a few things about investing. He conducted a fascinating study on stocks that returned $100 for every $1  invested. Yes, 100 to 1. Phelps found hundreds of such stocks, bunches  available in any single year, that you could have bought and enjoyed a  100-to-1 return on—if you had just held on. 
>
> This was the main thrust of our conversation: the key is not only finding  them, but keeping them. His basic conclusion can be summed up in the  phrase “buy right and hold on.”  “Let’s face it,” he said: “a great deal of investing is on par with the instinct  that makes a fish bite on an edible spinner because it is moving.” Investors  too bite on what’s moving and can’t sit on a stock that isn’t going anywhere.  They also lose patience with one that is moving against them. This causes  them to make a lot of trades and never enjoy truly mammoth returns.  Investors crave activity, and Wall Street is built on it. The media feeds  it all, making it seem as if important things happen every day. Hundreds  of millions of shares change hands every session. 

> Phelps showed me a little table that reveals how much and for how  long a stock must compound its value to multiply a hundredfold:

> Phelps advises looking for new methods, new materials and new products—things that improve life, that solve problems and allow us to do  things better, faster and cheaper.

> Phelps is quick to add he is not advocating blindly holding onto stocks.  “My advice to buy right and hold on is intended to counter unproductive activity,” he said, “not to recommend putting them away and forgetting them.” 

* The last quote is a brilliant point. While holding is great, it is important to monitor this. In later chapter, Christopher also remarks that ideally he holds the stock for as long as ROE is growing, unless valuation (P/E) becomes outrageous. 
* Christopher concludes this chapter with a lovely remark : "Investing is, arguably, more art than science,  anyway. If investing well were all about statistics, then the best investors  would be statisticians. And that is not the case.  We’re looking for insights and wisdom, not hard laws and proofs. 

### 2. Chapter 2 : Anybody can do this : True Stories
* Short chapter ; stories of people who did 100 bagger

### 3. Chapter 3 : The coffee can portfolio

* As the name suggests, this chapter brings out the concept of Coffee can portfolio, which is covered to a great extent by another brilliant book "The Coffee Can Investing" by Saurabh Mukherjea.

* The idea is simple: you find the best stocks you can and let them sit  for 10 years. You don't put anything in your coffee can you don't think is a good 10-year bet. 

* 10-year is a good time. Atleast analyzing and pruning the stocks. While to get a 100 baggers, you have to let it go, you also have to embrace the reality that world s changing rapidly. The survival rate is low. 

  * For example, take a look at the average lifespan  of a firm in the S&P 500 index. It is now less than 20 years. In 1958, it was 61 years. 

  * In indian context, **Of the original 30 companies that made up the SENSEX in 1986 (base year 1979), **only 7 remain** in the index today.

  * In the last 10 years alone, the SENSEX has seen a churn rate of roughly **50%**. This means that if you look at the index today, half of these companies likely won't be there in 2036.

* Moral : Coffee can is a good approach as it eliminates short term action / activity. But it is not "buy-and-forget", re-visit periodically. 



### 4. Chapter 4 : Study of 100-Baggers

* A fellow named Tony at TS Analysis published one informal 15-page study  called “An Analysis of 100-Baggers.”. Main takeaways he presented:

1. The most powerful stock moves tended to be during extended  periods of growing earnings accompanied by an expansion of  the P/E ratio.  
2. These periods of P/E expansion often seem to coincide with  periods of accelerating earnings growth.  
3. Some of the most attractive opportunities occur in beaten-down,  forgotten stocks, which perhaps after years of losses are returning  to profitability. 
4.  During such periods of rapid share price appreciation, stock prices  can reach lofty P/E ratios. This shouldn’t necessarily deter one  from continuing to hold the stock. 

* **Main Takeaway: Growth, Growth and more growth are what power these movers**

* Indian stock study also done with Motilal Oswal (to be written in separate article, these guys have brilliant analysis on their website). Their main summary for 100 baggers:

* Importance of Management is something that comes up in future chapters too.








## Favorite Quotes
* “Every human problem is an investment opportunity if you can anticipate  the solution,” the old gentleman told me. “Except for thieves, who would  buy locks?” 

* Investing is, arguably, more art than science,  anyway. If investing well were all about statistics, then the best investors  would be statisticians. And that is not the case.  We’re looking for insights and wisdom, not hard laws and proofs.
