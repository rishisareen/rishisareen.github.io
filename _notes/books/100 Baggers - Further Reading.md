Further Reading:
* Motilal Oswal 100x Report 
	* Check what was the initial market size / revenue of those companies which went 100x. Check which year it was and if I need to adjust to current level for inflation. I am wondering if 100 crore is a good place to start with. 
	* From the book 100 Baggers: "**The median sales figure of the 365 names in the study was about $170 million**. This is unadjusted for inflation. It simply shows you that 100-baggers can start off as sizable companies. Sales of $170 million makes for a substantial business in any era."
* Motilal Oswal Annual Wealth Creation Report
	* 
* **The Outsiders: Eight Unconventional CEOs and Their Radically Rational Blueprint for Success** *
