# The India Growth Manual: A Student’s Guide to the Stock Market

I believe that the best way to master a complex subject is to write about it. As I build systems to automate the screening of over 2,000 Indian companies, and find high growth stocks (or multibaggers, as I like to call it), I’ve documented the fundamental "infrastructure" of our market to clear my own thinking and help others get started.

This 4-part series is my personal roadmap for navigating India's ~$5.45 Trillion (₹450 Lakh Crore) economy. Whether you are a DIY investor or just curious about the "Big Picture," these notes are designed to simplify the noise.

### **A Note from the Author**

These articles represent my journey of reading, learning, and sharing in public. I am not a financial advisor, nor do I have anything to sell. I’ve found that thoughts only become truly clear once they are written down and shared. 

If you would like to follow along as I build systems to filter the market and pick individual stocks, drop me a note at **rsareen@gmail.com**, and I will add you to my personal distribution list.
