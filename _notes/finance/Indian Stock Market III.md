# Performance & Strategy : Where is the wealth

In the previous articles, we built the stadium (Exchanges) and picked the players (Market Cap). Now, we look at the scorecard of history. By comparing the last 20 years of data, we can see how different "players" perform over time and how they stack up against traditional favorites like Gold and Real Estate.

## 1. The 20 Year Marathon  (2006–2026) 

Over two decades, the Indian market has undergone a structural transformation. If you had invested ₹1 Lakh in 2006, here is how your wealth would have compounded across different segments:

| Segment / Asset          | CAGR   | Multiplier | ₹1,00,000 → |
| ------------------------ | ------ | ---------- | ----------- |
| NIFTY 50 (Large)         | ~13.1% | **11.8×**  | ₹11.8 L     |
| NIFTY Midcap 150         | ~15.8% | **18.9×**  | ₹18.9 L     |
| NIFTY Smallcap 250       | ~13.9% | **13.6×**  | ₹13.6 L     |
| NIFTY Microcap 250*      | ~16.2% | **20.0×**  | ₹20.0 L     |
| Gold (24K)               | 14.8%  | **15.0×**  | ₹15.0 L     |
| Real Estate (avg + rent) | ~7%    | **3.87×**  | ₹3.87 L     |

Key Takeaways:

* **Gold's Surprise :** One of the most striking observations is that **Gold outperformed Large-Cap equities** (Nifty 50) over the 20-year stretch. While we often think of stocks as the ultimate wealth creator, Gold has acted as a remarkably resilient and powerful hedge in the Indian context.
* **Micro-Cap Volatility:** While micro caps delivered the highest CAGR, they did so with significantly higher price swings.
* Real estate appreciated steadily with yield.

## 2. The 10 Year Era (2016–2026) : The Formalization Wave

In this decade, lot of business sectors moved from unorganized to listed, tax-compliant companies. India went through a digitalization wave along with GST implementation

| Segment / Asset          | CAGR   | Multiplier | ₹1,00,000 → |
| ------------------------ | ------ | ---------- | ----------- |
| NIFTY 50 (Large)         | 14.56% | **3.86×**  | ₹3.86 L     |
| NIFTY Midcap 150         | 22.61% | **7.70×**  | ₹7.70 L     |
| NIFTY Smallcap 250       | 20.54% | **6.50×**  | ₹6.50 L     |
| NIFTY Microcap 250       | 28.55% | **12.10×** | ₹12.10 L    |
| Gold (24K)               | 18.5%  | **5.45×**  | ₹5.45 L     |
| Real Estate (avg + rent) | ~8%    | **2.16×**  | ₹2.16 L     |

**Summary**

* Mid, small, and micro caps sharply outperformed, with microcap delivering nearly double the returns of the Nifty 50. This was the era where "hidden gems" became mid-sized stars.

* Gold strengthened. Real estate lagged equities.
* **BSE Market Cap:** The total market cap grew from **₹105 L Cr** in 2016 to **₹465 L Cr** by 2026.
* **Comparison to Assets:** This growth was so aggressive that the equity market reached a scale comparable to India's massive household gold reserves (**₹450 L Cr**).

## 3. The 5 Year Sprint (2021–2026) : The Liquidity Surge

The first half of this period was marked by an influx of cheap capital and high global liquidity, which acted as a "rising tide" lifting all boats, regardless of company size. When you hear FII money coming in (and now going away), this was driving lot of market surge. 

| Segment / Asset          | CAGR   | Multiplier | ₹1,00,000 → |
| ------------------------ | ------ | ---------- | ----------- |
| NIFTY 50 (Large)         | 16.62% | **2.15×**  | ₹2.15 L     |
| NIFTY Midcap 150         | 24.81% | **3.03×**  | ₹3.03 L     |
| NIFTY Smallcap 250       | 24.18% | **2.95×**  | ₹2.95 L     |
| NIFTY Microcap 250       | 30.24% | **3.72×**  | ₹3.72 L     |
| Gold (24K)               | 23.1%  | **2.83×**  | ₹2.83 L     |
| Real Estate (avg + rent) | ~10%   | **1.61×**  | ₹1.61 L     |

**Summary**

* **Why did Micro Caps dominate?** Because Micro Caps have lower liquidity, even a small amount of new investor interest can push prices up significantly. This 30%+ CAGR is exceptional and highlights the massive "Alpha" available in the smallest tier during bull runs.
* **Hyper-Growth in Micro Caps:** The NIFTY Microcap 250 delivered a high **30.24% CAGR** during this 5-year window, the highest across all equity segments.
* **Small Cap Momentum:** NIFTY Smallcap 250 followed closely with a **24.18% CAGR**, reflecting the market's appetite for risk.



## 4. The Verdict : Build your strategy 

Based on these 20 years of history, how should you view your portfolio?

- **Large Caps for Stability:** They provide the "floor" for your portfolio but may be outperformed by Gold during long stretches of global uncertainty.
- **Mid Caps for Durable Growth:** This is where the most consistent compounding happened over 20 years.
- **Small & Micro Caps for Alpha:** These are your "high-risk" bets. They provide massive returns during liquidity booms but come with significant price swings.
- **Gold & Real Estate:** These are not just "old-fashioned" assets. Gold is a powerful hedge, and Real Estate provides steady income and low volatility.
