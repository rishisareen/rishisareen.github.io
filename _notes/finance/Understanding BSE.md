To understand Indian Stock Market, first step is understand its composition and its top players and how it has evolved so far. These are my notes for same study :

## 1. What is BSE (as Exchange)

* BSE stands for the **Bombay Stock Exchange**, which is the oldest stock exchange in Asia. It was established in 1875. It is located on Dalal Street in Mumbai.
* BSE is the infrastructure where thousands of other companies (like Reliance, TCS, or Titan) list their shares so the public can trade them. It is the platform that provides the **Sensex** index.
* It hosts over 5000 listed companies, making it one of the largest exchanges in the world.
* **Flagship Index (Sensex):** The S&P BSE Sensex is the benchmark index, representing **30 of the largest and most actively traded stocks**, often serving as a barometer for the Indian economy.
* **Market Capitalization:** **As of Jan 2026, the BSE's total market capitalization is roughly $5.3 Trillion (Approx 1.15 Lakh Crore INR)**
* **Regulation:** It operates under the strict regulation of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI).
* **Offerings:** It facilitates trading in equities, derivatives (futures and options), debt instruments, mutual funds, and currencies.
* **Trading Hours:** The equity market operates from 9:15 AM to 3:30 PM IST, Monday to Friday


## 1.1 BSE as Business

* BSE often refers to two distinct but related things: the Exchange and the Stock
* The Exchange itself is **for profit business.** It earns money from:
  * **Transaction Charges:** A small fee every time someone buys or sells a stock on its platform.
  * **Listing Fees:** Yearly fees paid by the 5,000+ companies to stay listed on the exchange.
  * **Data Feeds:** Selling market data to news outlets and trading terminals (like Bloomberg).
  * **Services:** Clearing, settlement, and depository services

**Interesting Note** : 
* **BSE Ltd (the company) is not listed on the BSE (the exchange).** In India, SEBI (the regulator) does not allow a stock exchange to list its own shares on itself to avoid a **conflict of interest**. If BSE were listed on BSE, they would be regulating their own stock's disclosures.
* BSE stock price has given 124% return over last 5 year, which makes it top growing stock in 2020-25

### 1.1.1 Services Provided by BSE Ltd

These three services as the "behind-the-scenes" workers who make sure that when you buy a stock, you actually get it, and when you sell it, you actually get paid.

- **Clearing (The Accountant):** Before any assets move, this step double-checks who owes what. It groups all trades together to find the "final balance" and acts as a middleman to guarantee that the deal will go through, even if one person backs out.
- **Settlement (The Delivery Man):** This is the actual moment of exchange. It ensures that the shares move into the buyer's account at the exact same time the money moves into the seller's account. **In India, this happens just one business day after the trade (T+1).**
- **Depository (The Digital Vault):** In the past, shares were physical paper certificates. Today, they exist only in digital (dematerialized) form. A Depository is essentially a bank for your shares. In India, there are two main depositories:
  - **CDSL** (Central Depository Services Ltd): Promoted by BSE.
  - **NSDL** (National Securities Depository Ltd): Promoted by NSE

### 2. BSE Sensex : How the "Top 30" Are Chosen: Entry Criteria

Not every large company makes it into the Sensex. The index is curated using a rigorous "Free-Float Market Capitalization" methodology. The key criteria include:

- **Listing History:** The company must be listed on the BSE for at least three months.
- **Size:** It must be among the top companies by market cap (usually within the top 75-100 candidates).
- **Liquidity:** The stock must be traded on every trading day and maintain a high turnover rate.
- **Sector Representation:** The index committee ensures that the 30 companies reflect the broad sectoral balance of the Indian economy.
  - Companies like **Bank of Baroda** or **Canara Bank** often have the free-float market capitalization to be in the Top 30. However, because the Sensex already has heavyweights like HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank, SBI, and Axis Bank, adding more banks would make the index a "Bank Index" rather than a "Market Index."
  - Sometimes, the committee adds a company from a new or emerging sector to ensure the Sensex stays modern. In recent years, companies like **Zomato** (E-commerce) and **Trent** (Retail) were added to the Sensex. At the time of their inclusion, there might have been older, "boring" industrial companies with similar or slightly higher market caps


**Interesting Note :**
* LIC, which has overall market cap of 6.5 lakh crore is NOT in sensex. This is because of "Free Float Market Cap" rule. Govt of India owns 96% of LIC, so only 4% of stock is tradable (which comes to 0.26 Lakh Crore)
* There are several other such examples : HAL, Coal India, Adani Total Gas, DMart. 
* Being in the Sensex 30 is a massive advantage because **Passive Funds (ETFs)** are forced to buy the stock. If a company has the market cap but is "skipped" due to sector balance, it misses out on these massive automatic inflows


### 2.1 Top 10 Heavyweights (The Market Movers)

* These 10 companies alone account for nearly 70% of total sensex movement

### 3. How BSE Sensex has evolved over the period

The composition of the BSE has undergone a massive structural transformation over the last 30-40 years.

- **The Industrial Era (Pre-1990s):** The index was dominated by heavy manufacturing, textiles, and commodity-based conglomerates.
- **The Transition (2006):** By the mid-2000s, **Financial Services** held a ~20% weight, with **IT Services** (led by the 1990s tech boom) and **Oil & Gas** playing major roles.
- **The Modern Era (2026):** We now see a "Financialized" and "Consumer-driven" index.
  - **Financial Services:** Now commands nearly **39%** of the weight.
  - **Consumption & Lifestyle:** Sectors like Consumer Discretionary (Jewelry, Automobiles) have tripled their influence, growing from ~3% to **~9%**.
  - **IT & Energy:** These remain stable pillars but have seen their relative weightage dilute as domestic credit and consumption grew faster.
  
    

### 4. Indian Market growth

| **Period**      | **Start Price** | **End Price** | **CAGR (%)** | **Era Context**                                       |
| --------------- | --------------- | ------------- | ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **1980 - 1985** | 123.54          | 287.62        | **18.41%**   | Early growth, pre-liberalization.                     |
| **1985 - 1990** | 287.62          | 683.32        | **18.90%**   | Index launch and steady buildup.                      |
| **1990 - 1995** | 683.32          | 3,618.54      | **39.57%**   | **The Liberalization Surge.** (Highest growth period) |
| **1995 - 2000** | 3,618.54        | 5,205.29      | **7.54%**    | Post-Harshad Mehta crash & Asian crisis.              |
| **2000 - 2005** | 5,205.29        | 6,555.94      | **4.72%**    | Dot-com bust & global stagnation.                     |
| **2005 - 2010** | 6,555.94        | 16,357.96     | **20.07%**   | The Infrastructure & Credit Bull Run.                 |
| **2010 - 2015** | 16,357.96       | 29,182.95     | **12.28%**   | Post-GFC recovery and policy paralysis era.           |
| **2015 - 2020** | 29,182.95       | 40,723.49     | **6.89%**    | Demo, GST implementation, and pre-COVID.              |
| **2020 - 2025** | 40,723.49       | 77,500.57     | **13.73%**   | The Post-Pandemic Digital/Retail Rally.               |
| **2025 - 2026** | 77,500.57       | 82,344.68     | **6.25%**    | Recent consolidation (Partial Period).                |

**Key Takeaway:**

* The **highest returns** came during periods of **structural change**, not during normal growth years. 1990–95 after liberalization and 2005–10 during the credit and infrastructure boom stand out.
* Periods of **global or domestic stress** show up as long stretches of muted CAGR. 1995–2005 and 2015–2020 were not exciting return periods despite India continuing to grow. Same story is unfolding today.
