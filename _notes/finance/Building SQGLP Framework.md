Focus is to build SQGLP framwork 



## Quality of Company

It has two parts :

* Quality of Business
* Quality of Management



### Quality of Business

* **Profit Pool & Value Migration:** Determine if the company operates in a sector with a large aggregate profit pool. Research whether the company is a beneficiary of **Value Migration** :  where value is moving from outmoded business designs to more efficient ones.

* **Economic Moat:** Identify if the company has a sustainable competitive advantage, such as being a **low-cost producer** or owning a **powerful brand**.

*  **Financial Efficiency:** Look for a **Return on Equity (RoE)** consistently above 15%. Use **DuPont Analysis** to see if this RoE is driven by healthy profit margins and asset turnover rather than just high leverage.

* **Terms of Trade:** Check if the company has bargaining power by comparing **Debtors to Creditors**; a ratio below 1.0 indicates favorable terms where the company collects cash faster than it pays suppliers



### Quality of Business

* **Integrity:** Research the track record for corporate governance. Indicators of high integrity include **paying full taxes**, a transparent **dividend policy**, and a lack of "Sharp Practices" (accounting gimmicks to inflate profits).

* **Competence & Growth Mindset:** Evaluate the management’s ability to allocate capital efficiently and their "passion" for expanding the business without destroying value.

* **Skin in the Game:** Check for high **promoter holding** and ensure that a significant portion of those shares are **not pledged**.



### AI Prompt



Act as a professional equity research analyst specializing in long-term wealth creation. Perform a deep-dive analysis on **[Insert Company Name]** using the **SQGLP** framework, **DuPont Analysis**, and specific valuation heuristics. Provide a report with the following sections:

### **1. Quality of Business (Q & L)**

- **Economic Moat:** Identify the company’s sustainable competitive advantage (e.g., brand power, low-cost production, or high switching costs).
- **Profit Pool & Value Migration:** Is the company in a sector with a large profit pool? Is it a beneficiary of 'Value Migration' (moving from outmoded to superior business designs)?
- **Industry Structure:** Assess the sector using Porter’s Five Forces. Is the industry stable and conducive to a long **Competitive Advantage Period (CAP)**?

### **2. Quality of Management (Q)**

- **Integrity & Governance:** Research the track record for 'Sharp Practices.' Does the company pay its full share of taxes and maintain a consistent dividend policy?
- **Skin in the Game:** What is the current promoter holding? Is there a history of pledging shares or high related-party transactions?

### **3. DuPont Analysis (5-Year Trend)**

Break down the **Return on Equity (RoE)** into its three levers to determine if growth is organic or engineered:

1. **Profitability (PAT Margin):** Is the margin rising due to pricing power or cost efficiency?
2. **Asset Efficiency (Asset Turnover):** How effectively is the company generating sales from its assets?
3. **Financial Leverage (Equity Multiplier):** Is the RoE being boosted by excessive debt, or is the gearing falling?

### **4. Growth (G) & Valuation (P)**

- **Earnings Growth:** Provide the 3-year and 5-year PAT CAGR. Is growth driven by volume, price, or operating leverage?
- **PEG Ratio:** Calculate the Trailing PEG (P/E divided by 5-year PAT CAGR). Is it **below 1.0** (the golden rule for 100-baggers)?
- **Payback Ratio:** Calculate the Payback Ratio (Current Market Cap divided by estimated profits over the next five years). Is it **less than 1x**?

### **5. Summary Checklist**

- Does the company have a market cap **under $1 billion (INR 75b)** to allow for the low-base effect?
- Is the RoE consistently **above 15%**?
- Conclude whether the company qualifies as a **'Great'** business or a **'Quality Trap'** based on the Quality-Growth matrix.





### Growth Prompt

------

**Prompt Template:**

Act as an expert equity analyst specializing in identifying multi-bagger stocks. Generate a comprehensive Earnings Quality & Valuation Report for **[Insert Company Name/Ticker]** using the latest available financial data.

**CRITICAL FORMATTING INSTRUCTION:** You must strictly format your response using Markdown tables and concise bullet points. Avoid dense paragraphs.

Please structure your analysis strictly according to the following sections:

**1. Earnings Growth Profile** Create a 2-column table displaying the 3-Year PAT CAGR and 5-Year PAT CAGR.

**2. The 4-Lever Earnings Decomposition** Create a table with three columns: **Lever**, **Status/Observation**, and **Analysis**. Break down the historical earnings growth using these four drivers:

- **Volume Growth:** Are raw unit sales/deliverables increasing organically?
- **Price Lever:** Is revenue growing faster than volume, indicating premiumization or pricing power?
- **Operating Lever:** How is operating profit (EBIT) responding to sales growth? Is there evidence of high fixed-cost leverage expanding margins?
- **Financial Lever:** How is the capital structure (interest burden) impacting Net Income relative to EBIT?

**3. Growth Synthesis** Use concise bullet points to explicitly state whether the 3-year and 5-year PAT growth is primarily driven by Volume expansion, Price realization, Operating Leverage, or Financial Leverage. Flag if the growth is low-quality (e.g., driven solely by debt or tax shields rather than operating fundamentals).

**4. Valuation Reality Check**

- Create a brief table showing the Current P/E Ratio, 5-Year PAT CAGR, and the calculated Trailing PEG Ratio.
- **Verdict:** Provide a one-sentence bullet point stating whether the PEG ratio is below 1.0 (the golden rule for 100-baggers) and whether the current valuation is justified by the underlying quality of the earnings drivers.
