My notes to understand Indian Stock Market from high level and then go to macroscopic view.

First step is to understand where is this market, where all stocks are available to buy and sell. 



## 1. Indian Stock Exchanges : BSE and NSE 

What are Stock Exchanges? Simply, they are platform / infrastructure where we can buy and sell our shares. 

In India, we've two biggest exchanges : **BSE** and **NSE**

**BSE**
* BSE stands for the **Bombay Stock Exchange**, which is the oldest stock exchange in Asia. It was established in 1875.  
* It has **5000** listed companies, making it one of the largest exchanges in the world. 
* **Benchmark Index:** **SENSEX** (comprising the top 30 largest companies)

**NSE**
* NSE stands for **National Stock Exchange**. It was launched much later in 1992. It was was the "tech disruptor" of its time. It brought fully automated, screen-based electronic trading to India, ending the old era of brokers shouting on a physical trading floor.
* While it has fewer listings (~**2,400** companies), it commands nearly **90% of the trading volume**.
* **Benchmark Index:** **NIFTY 50** (comprising the top 50 largest companies)


Both BSE and NSE provide the infrastructure where thousands of other companies (like Reliance, TCS, or Titan) list their shares so the public can trade them. 

* **Market Capitalization: As of Jan 2026,** 
  * BSE's total market capitalization is roughly $5.45 Trillion (Approx 451 Lakh Crore INR)**
  * NSE total market capitalization is around $5.39 Trillion (Approx 447 Lakh Crore)
  * Most major companies (like Reliance, TCS, Titan) are **dual-listed** on both exchanges. This means the total Indian market cap is roughly the BSE figure, as it encompasses almost everything on the NSE plus several thousand more

* **Regulation:** Both operates under the strict regulation of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI).

* **Offerings:** It facilitates trading in equities, derivatives (futures and options), debt instruments, mutual funds, and currencies.

* **Trading Hours:** The equity market operates from 9:15 AM to 3:30 PM IST, Monday to Friday

* BSE as a business is listed on NSE  (it cant list on its own exchange due to regulations), NSE is not yet listed. Infact, BSE was fastest growing stock in 2020-25 period (124% growth)

## 2. Benchmark Indices : Selection and Entry Criteria

While the Sensex 30 and Nifty 50 are managed by different exchanges, they share a common goal: to represent the "best of the best" in the Indian economy. Both indices use a **Free-Float Market Capitalization** methodology, meaning only the shares available for public trading are considered for valuation.

- **Listing History:** Companies must have a minimum listing track record (usually 3–6 months) to ensure they aren't "one-hit wonders."
- **Size:** It must be among the top companies by market cap (usually within the top 75-100 candidates).
- **Liquidity:** The stock must be traded on every trading day and maintain a high turnover rate.
- **Sector Representation:** The index committee ensures that the companies reflect the broad sectoral balance of the Indian economy.
  - Companies like **Bank of Baroda** or **Canara Bank** often have the free-float market capitalization to be in the Top 30. However, because the Sensex already has heavyweights like HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank, SBI, and Axis Bank, adding more banks would make the index a "Bank Index" rather than a "Market Index."
  - Sometimes, the committee adds a company from a new or emerging sector to ensure the Sensex stays modern. In recent years, companies like **Zomato** (E-commerce) and **Trent** (Retail) were added to the Sensex. At the time of their inclusion, there might have been older, "boring" industrial companies with similar or slightly higher market caps



#### **Interesting Notes :**

* LIC, which has overall market cap of 6.5 lakh crore is NOT in sensex. This is because of "Free Float Market Cap" rule. Govt of India owns 96% of LIC, so only 4% of stock is tradable (which comes to 0.26 Lakh Crore)
* There are several other such examples : HAL, Coal India, Adani Total Gas, DMart. 
* Being in the Sensex 30 is a massive advantage because **Passive Funds (ETFs)** are forced to buy the stock. If a company has the market cap but is "skipped" due to sector balance, it misses out on these massive automatic inflows

### 2.1 Top 10 Heavyweights (The Market Movers)

* These 10 companies alone account for nearly 70% of total sensex movement

## 3. The Shift: How Indian Indices Have Evolved

The composition of the Sensex and Nifty 50 has undergone a massive structural transformation over the last 40 years, effectively mirroring the evolution of the Indian economy itself.

- **The Industrial Era (Pre-1990s):** The index was dominated by heavy manufacturing, textiles, and commodity-based conglomerates.

- **The Transition (2006):** By the mid-2000s, **Financial Services** held a ~20% weight, with **IT Services** (led by the 1990s tech boom) and **Oil & Gas** playing major roles.

- **The Modern Era (2026):** We now see a "Financialized" and "Consumer-driven" index.
  - **Financial Services:** Now commands nearly **39%** of the weight.

  - **Consumption & Lifestyle:** Sectors like Consumer Discretionary (Jewelry, Automobiles) have tripled their influence, growing from ~3% to **~9%**.

  - **IT & Energy:** These remain stable pillars but have seen their relative weightage dilute as domestic credit and consumption grew faster.

    

### Summary of Sector Evolution

| **Sector**             | **Pre-1990s** | **Mid-2000s** | **2026 (Modern)** |
| ---------------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ----------------- |
| **Financial Services** | Minimal       | ~20%          | **~35-39%**       |

## 4. Indian Market growth

| **Period**      | **Start Price** | **End Price** | **CAGR (%)** | **Era Context**                                       |
| --------------- | --------------- | ------------- | ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **1980 - 1985** | 123.54          | 287.62        | **18.41%**   | Early growth, pre-liberalization.                     |
| **1985 - 1990** | 287.62          | 683.32        | **18.90%**   | Index launch and steady buildup.                      |
| **1990 - 1995** | 683.32          | 3,618.54      | **39.57%**   | **The Liberalization Surge.** (Highest growth period) |
| **1995 - 2000** | 3,618.54        | 5,205.29      | **7.54%**    | Post-Harshad Mehta crash & Asian crisis.              |
| **2000 - 2005** | 5,205.29        | 6,555.94      | **4.72%**    | Dot-com bust & global stagnation.                     |
| **2005 - 2010** | 6,555.94        | 16,357.96     | **20.07%**   | The Infrastructure & Credit Bull Run.                 |
| **2010 - 2015** | 16,357.96       | 29,182.95     | **12.28%**   | Post-GFC recovery and policy paralysis era.           |
| **2015 - 2020** | 29,182.95       | 40,723.49     | **6.89%**    | Demo, GST implementation, and pre-COVID.              |
| **2020 - 2025** | 40,723.49       | 77,500.57     | **13.73%**   | The Post-Pandemic Digital/Retail Rally.               |
| **2025 - 2026** | 77,500.57       | 82,344.68     | **6.25%**    | Recent consolidation (Partial Period).                |

**Key Takeaway:**

* The **highest returns** came during periods of **structural change**, not during normal growth years. 1990–95 after liberalization and 2005–10 during the credit and infrastructure boom stand out.
* Periods of **global or domestic stress** show up as long stretches of muted CAGR. 1995–2005 and 2015–2020 were not exciting return periods despite India continuing to grow. Same story is unfolding today.
