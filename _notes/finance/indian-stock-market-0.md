# The India Growth Manual: A Student’s Guide to the Stock Market
I believe that the best way to master a complex subject is to write about it. As I build systems to automate the analysis of over 5,000 Indian companies listed on stock market, and find high growth stocks (or multibaggers, as I like to call it), I’ve documented the fundamental "infrastructure" of our market to clear my own thinking and help others get started.

This 4-part series is my personal roadmap for navigating India's ~$5.45 Trillion (₹450 Lakh Crore) economy. Whether you are a DIY investor or just curious about the "Big Picture," these notes are designed to simplify the noise. 
I find today Financial planning is overly complicated, some by design (so you need expert handholding), or some by too many players. Basic financial planning is actually simple, if we spend some time to understand this.
So, come and follow along. This entire series should not take more than 20-30" of your time. It will be worth the read.

## **A Note from the Author**

These articles represent my journey of reading, learning, and sharing in public. I am not a financial advisor, nor do I have anything to sell to you. I’ve found that thoughts only become truly clear once they are written down and shared. 

If you would like to follow along as I build systems to filter the market and pick individual stocks, drop me a note at **rsareen@gmail.com**, and I will add you to my personal distribution list.
