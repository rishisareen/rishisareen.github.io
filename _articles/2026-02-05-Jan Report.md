This is the first edition of my monthly review, inspired by my friend Protima. This is my attempt to take an honest look at how each month went across the pillars that matter to me. 

---

Ryan and I ringed in New Year, watching Home Alone 2 together. Could not have asked for a better start. We laughed our way to year start. If 1st of Jan is a reflection of how the year will go, I am a happy man.

## Family & Relationships

As Riya is busy with her exams prep, Ryan was at the center of January. We cycled together, watched movies, spent mornings just being around each other. My heart is full when I think about it.

My little daughter took her IIT exam this month. Time really flies, cliche but so true. 

We also went to a Calum Scott concert together, and I'll remember that evening for a long time. Wonderful music, made even more special as we were doing it together. Thanks to Riya, I continue to discover some amazing music. 

Socially, this was a rich month. Deep conversation with friends over lunch and dinner, it was an active month. And crewing for Rohin's 24-hour stadium run attempt, which was an experience in itself (he pushed hard for 11 hours before wisely stopping).

## Travel & Experiences

The highlight was an [8-day Goa trip](https://rishisareen.com/photography/goa-trip/) with Mom and Ryan. Goa always feel like second home. We spent four days in South Goa, three in North Goa, and a memorable finale at Taj Fort Aguada. We went out to eat every day, chilled and and made memories. That trip set the tone for the year.

## Finance & Investing

This was my strongest pillar in January, and I'm genuinely excited about it.

I finished reading *100 Baggers* by Christopher Mayer and published [my notes](https://rishisareen.com/notes/finance/100-baggers-book-review/). I dug into a [2014 Motilal Oswal report](https://rishisareen.com/notes/finance/100%20Baggers%20-%20Indian%20Context/) on Indian 100-baggers and started replicating the study with 2026 data. I discovered a company called Control Panel Ltd that I want to research further. By month's end, I was spending full days immersed in financial analysis and loving every minute of it.

There's a long way to go before this translates into actual investing results (atleast my ambitious goal), but the foundation is being built with real depth. The goal is to develop an independent investing framework.  Not just follow tips, but truly understand businesses. I've been studying finance for 2+ years now, and now it is all coming together. With AI and deep research coming, things are accerating quickly. 

## Learning & Reading

A voracious month. The standout was [*Psycho Cybernetics* by Maxwell Maltz](https://rishisareen.com/notes/books/psycho-cybernetics/). I read most of the book with detailed notes, and it arrived at exactly the right time. Its ideas about self-image, the power of mental rehearsal, and how we can reprogram our internal thermostat are influencing how I think about everything. From fitness goals to personal growth. I've taken 2 targets for me from this book's lessons which I will share soon. 

Other books I spent time with: Vadim Zeland's *Transurfing* (exploring ideas about manifesting and parallel realities with an open mind), Dan Brown's *The Secret of Secrets* (which led me down a rabbit hole on consciousness, GABA, and psychedelics), and some Osho for meditation perspectives.

I also wrote an article on which [preventive health tests](https://rishisareen.com/articles/BloodTests/) everyone should do, and shared it with my friend groups. It felt good to create something useful and put it out there.

## Wellness & Fitness

After the Goa trip, I had to rebuild. My resting heart rate had crept up to 51 (normally I sit around 44-45), which told me my cardiovascular fitness had dipped. I committed to the MAF protocol to bring it back gradually.

Gym sessions went from zero to two per week by month's end, plus cycling with Ryan and long walks. I also made a Hyrox training plan, something I'm genuinely excited to pursue. The consistency isn't where I want it yet, but I've done this enough number of times to know how to get back. 

The break was deliberate and I feel fresh and raring to go now. 

## Mind & Meditation

Here's my honest struggle. I declared meditation as priority #1 for 2026. And January was again inconsistent.

I started on January 12th. Then it fell off. I tried again. Fell off again. By the end of the month, I diagnosed the real problem: I was spending more time optimizing the *method* -- Calm app or Insight Timer? Guided or unguided? Active meditation or stillness? -- than actually sitting down and doing it.

The resolution going into February is simple: 5 minutes on Insight Timer. No optimization. Just sit. If I can build the habit first, I can refine the technique later.

The interest in consciousness is genuine and deep, I'm reading about it, thinking about it, exploring it through multiple authors. But the daily practice needs to catch up with the intellectual curiosity.



## The Honest Scorecard

| Pillar | How It Went |
|---|---|
| Family & Relationships | **Strong.** Deep presence with Ryan and Riya. Active, meaningful friendships. |
| Travel & Experiences | **Strong.** Goa trip was the highlight. Bangkok planned. |
| Finance & Investing | **Very Strong.** Most focused pillar of the month. Real depth being built. |
| Learning & Reading | **Very Strong.** Multiple books, detailed notes, articles published. |
| Wellness & Fitness | **Building.** Restarting after a break. Upward trend. |
| Mind & Meditation | **Struggling.** High intention, low execution. Problem diagnosed. |

## Looking Ahead to February

The mantra going into February: **consistency over intensity.** The foundations are laid in finance, reading, and relationships. Now it's about locking in the daily habits : meditation, gym, and giving more to work.

My affirmation for January was *"I am a warrior monk."* I'm carrying it forward. The warrior shows up and does the work. The monk stays present and at peace. Both are needed.
