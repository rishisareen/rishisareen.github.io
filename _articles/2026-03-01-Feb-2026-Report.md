# Monthly Review: February 2026

This is the second edition of my monthly review. If January was about laying foundations, February was about making hard decisions and showing up consistently. The theme of this month was consistency. 

---

The month opened with a 12-hour finance study marathon and ended with a Sufi night at Sundar Nursery. Somewhere in between, I closed a chapter that needed closing, hit a personal best in the gym, meditated almost every single day, and published two articles I'd been putting off for weeks. Not bad for the shortest month of the year.

## Family & Relationships

Lot going on at this front. Riya is giving her board exams, and my role is mostly driving her around. Last few weeks of 12th!

Ryan and I had the best weekends: cycling to the farm, coding together, building a workout tracker app. We even purchased two domains :  findmearace.com and ryansinghsareen.com ; with grand plans to build things together. That father-son energy is unmatched.

AI is already powerful and I am amazing how quickly a 12 year old boy can pick this up and build such sleek websites, which would have taken months for a professional teams to build.

Socially, the month was richer than expected. Long afternoon spent walking through a tulip garden and talking about manifestation and goals with a friend. A food trip with another friend :  just eating, walking, soaking in the chaos. An evening at Sundar Nursery with Sufi music floating through the air. I went to the *Mere Raam* theater show with Mom. None of these were planned events, but I definately made best use of Delhi limited spring. 

## Wellness & Fitness

This was my most consistent fitness month in a long time. 19 gym sessions. I hit a 180kg leg press : a personal best that felt amazing. The gym has become non-negotiable again, and I'm loving the push/pull/legs rotation.

The bigger win was solving my Zone 2 cardio problem. In January, I struggled with running because I was absolutely completely bored of it. 9+ years of triathlon-specific training had killed the novelty. I kept planning 3 runs a week and executing 1. So in February, I changed the goal: it's not about running, it's about Zone 2 fitness. And Zone 2 can come from cycling, rucking with weights, or incline walks. **That shift unlocked everything**. By the last week of February, I was hitting 5+ Zone 2 sessions alongside my gym work. Variety beat willpower. 

Protein intake has been mostly on track at 150g/day. This was a month of very good eating and results are coming. 

## Finance & Investing

The financial modeling project became my obsession this month, in the best way. I woke up at 5 AM some days with ideas buzzing, went straight to building. I studied Motilal Oswal's 30-year wealth creation reports, revised Professor Aswath Damodaran's valuation lectures, and started developing what I'm calling the Boundless 100x framework for stock analysis.

I also began reading *Hidden Investment Treasures*, though I didn't finish it. The honest truth is I spent more time modeling than reading this month, and I'm okay with that. The hands-on work is where the real learning happens. The goal to get world-class at understanding businesses is ambitious, but February made it feel possible. My finance domain knowledge for last 2 years + AI capability is making things progress at such a rapid pace.



## Learning & Writing

This was a breakthrough month for writing. After carrying the Ironman Journey article forward for three weeks, I finally sat down and [published it](https://rishisareen.com/articles/my-ironman-journey/). I also wrote and published my [January monthly report](https://rishisareen.com/articles/Jan-Report/) : the first edition of this newsletter. Getting both out felt like clearing a mental logjam.

On the reading front, I picked up *ADHD 2.0* but it didn't click. That's fine, not every book needs to connect. The deeper finance study (Damodaran, Motilal reports, company analysis) more than made up for it. Learning by doing : building models, analyzing companies is where my energy naturally flows right now.

Ryan and I also started building findmearace.com, a platform to help people discover races. No monetization plans yet, just the joy of creating something together.

## Mind & Meditation

Remember January's honest struggle? The inconsistent starts, the method-optimization trap, the gap between intellectual curiosity and actual practice?

February fixed it. 26 out of 28 days. Every morning, get up, 5 minutes on Insight Timer. No optimization, no debate about technique. Just sit. First thing in the morning.

The morning routine that emerged is simple: wake up, don't touch the phone, sit still, meditate, clean the room, make coffee. One morning I wrote in my journal with my eyes closed (yes, ofcourse, I can type without looking. Duh!), just feeling the calm. No tight breathing, no low-grade anxiety. That's what a phone-free morning feels like.

The affirmation that stuck: *"I am a warrior monk."* The warrior shows up and does the work. The monk stays present and at peace. I'm carrying it forward.

The habit is established. Now the question for March is: can I deepen it? Increase to 10 minutes? Start engaging with *The Mind Illuminated*?



## The Honest Scorecard

| Pillar | How It Went |
|---|---|
| Family & Relationships | **Strong.** Hard decision made. Deeper presence with Riya, Ryan, and Mom. Rich social month. |
| Wellness & Fitness | **Very Strong.** Most consistent month. 18+ gym sessions. Zone 2 problem solved. PR hit. |
| Finance & Investing | **Strong.** Financial modeling progressing well. Study momentum high. IB account and house selling lagging. |
| Learning & Writing | **Strong.** Two articles published. Finance deep-study. Building with Ryan. Books were lighter than January. |
| Mind & Meditation | **Transformed.** 26/28 days. From struggling to habit. The real win of February. |

## Looking Ahead to March

March is the final month of Q1. Hyrox Bangalore is in April (might go, my misogi race is Delhi Hyrox in July), so training intensity needs to step up. The meditation habit is locked, now it's about depth. The finance study continues. A dear friend is visiting mid-March, which I'm looking forward to.

But the real theme for March is simple: **remain consistent and close the loops.** Finish first pass of finance model, deeply study 5 companies and publish my report.  These are the small things that linger and drain energy when left undone.

The foundations are solid. Gym, meditation, finance study, relationships : all trending in the right direction. Now it's about execution and finishing Q1 strong. Read something beautiful on Insta : "Most days are not decisive, they are directional". This is what I focus on : the deliberate direction.

*I am a warrior monk.*
