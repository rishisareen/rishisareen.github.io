Since 2016, I've been conducting a self annual review towards end December. This gives me a chance to reflect on how the previous year went and what do I want to do in the coming year. 

I usually reserve 3-4 days to do this exercise ; it is more of thinking and digging deeper on what do I really want. 

The main process is simple and divided in three steps:

1. [**Step 1 : Reflect on the previous year**](https://rishisareen.com/blog/annualreview/Step1.html) : What was good, what was not so good. What did I learn, where I failed, how did I do compared to my target goals. Basically, the whole self assessment. 
2. **[Step 2 : Identify your intention](https://rishisareen.com/blog/annualreview/Step2.html)** : What is my focus area, where do I want to spend my energy. I usually operate with these pillars as main area : Physical Health, Mental Wellness, Learning, Finance, Office, Career, Travel, Fun and Relationships. Some years, more area arrive if they need specific focus. Like in 2026, Meditation is a pillar in itself.
3. **[Step 3 : Break down goals in each area](https://rishisareen.com/blog/annualreview/Step3.html)** : This is where the rubber meets the road. I built an entire workshop on this specific topic, but at high level idea is to make this concrete as much as possible and break it down into achievable parts

Supplement this exercise by a [Weekly Review](https://rishisareen.com/blog/general/Power-of-Weekly-Review.html) and you will be unstoppable.
