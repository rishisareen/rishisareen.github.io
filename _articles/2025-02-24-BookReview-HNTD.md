## Summary

**"How Not to Diet"** by **Dr. Michael Greger** is a science-backed guide to sustainable weight loss. The book explores the root causes of obesity and outlines practical strategies for long-term health, focusing on whole, plant-based foods. Dr. Greger argues that health and weight loss are closely intertwined, stating, “The single healthiest diet may also be the most effective diet for weight loss.”

**Key points:**

- **Whole-Food, Plant-Based Diet:** Emphasizing vegetables, fruits, legumes, and whole grains for nutrient density and fiber.
- **Calorie Density & Satiety:** Choosing low-calorie, high-fiber foods to feel full while consuming fewer calories.
- **Metabolism-Boosting Habits:** Eating specific foods (like greens and berries), timing meals, and exercising to naturally enhance metabolism.

## My Thoughts:

- **What I liked:**
	- I learned a lot about various aspects of health: the importance of gut microbes, the role of fiber, and the impact of inflammation. Dr. Greger cites almost every point he makes, adding credibility to his arguments.   
  - The book is written in an easy-to-read format, with plenty of anecdotes that keep the content engaging and relatable.
  
- **What I didn’t like as much:**
    - There seems to be a bias against fat and animal protein. When these topics come up, the discussion occasionally cherry-picks evidence to support a plant-based viewpoint. Two examples stood out to me:
        - **Eggs and TMAO Production:** The author claims eggs increase TMAO, which raises cardiovascular risk. However, when I explored his research notes and other studies, the linkage appeared weak and not thoroughly studied. Despite this, the book strongly advises against consuming eggs.
        - **Beef, Chicken, and Insulin Response:** The book states that beef and chicken cause the same insulin response as pure sugar. When I reviewed the referenced study (which had a small sample size of just seven people), the claim didn’t align with the study’s summary.
    
- **Overall:** This is a valuable book packed with insights. Most of the advice—eat more plants and fruits, avoid processed foods—is reflected in many other health books, but Dr. Greger’s depth of research makes it compelling. My main takeaway is to increase my fiber intake, add more fruits to my diet, and continue minimizing processed foods.

> “Given the right conditions, the body heals itself. If you whack your shin really hard on a coffee table, it can get red, swollen, and painful. But your shin will heal naturally if you just stand back and let your body work its magic. But what if you kept whacking it in the same place three times a day—say, at breakfast, lunch, and dinner? It would never heal. You could go to your doctor and complain that your shin hurts. “No problem,” he or she might say, whipping out a pad to write you a prescription for painkillers. You’d go back home, still whacking your shin three times a day, but the pain pills would make it feel so much better. Thank heavens for modern medicine!”."
