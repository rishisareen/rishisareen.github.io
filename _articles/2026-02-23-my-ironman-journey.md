The voice cut through 16 hours of exhaustion.

"From India, first-time triathlete, Rishi Sareen, you are an Ironman."

<!--more-->

I sprinted the red carpet, jumped, and finished strong. 

I had just finished what is called "World's Toughest Single Day Endurance event". I swam for 3.8km, then cycled 180km in Brutal Philippines hill and then ran a full marathon (42.2km). Ironman. Only 0.01% of the world has completed one.

Behind that lay two years of waking up at 4am, learning to swim from scratch, and one terrifying moment on a beach where I almost quit before the race even started.

But this story doesn't begin at a finish line. It begins with a conversation that changed everything.

## The Spark

Summer of 2016. My friend Anubhav and I were chatting during office coffee break. As it often happens, two friends full of more bravado and less common sense chat, he mentioned two big events happening soon in Delhi NCR : A 1500km cycle ride from Delhi to Mumbai, and a triathlon planned for early 2017, in middle of delhi winters. 

Something about the word "Triathlon" lit a fuse in me.

I went back to my desk and looked it up. Swim, Ride, Run. Three disciplines. One race.

Then I wrote down an honest assessment of where I stood :

- Swim : I could float. Couldn't breathe while swimming. **2 out of 10.**
- Run : Longest distance ever : 7km. **3 out of 10.**
- Ride : A few century rides. Not a complete beginner. **5 out of 10.**

After weighing all this very carefully, I signed up for the Half Ironman distance. The hardest option available.

A few weeks later, a bigger thought crystallized (do you see the patter here :)) : I wanted to do a *full* Ironman before my 40th birthday. A 3.8km ocean swim, 180km bike, and a full 42.2km marathon. All in one day.

I was 38. No athletic background. Couldn't swim. Had never run more than 7km.

But what is life without a crazy goal or two?

## Learning the Hard Way

**Swimming** was the biggest beast. Anubhav and I signed up with a coach at Delhi Sports Complex. It was a mess. Coaches kept changing, each contradicting the last. Someone would say kick more, another one wanted me to gain weight (you know fat floats better!)

The only useful thing I learned from them was how to stand in water.

Then, on Tim Ferriss podcast, I discovered "Total Immersion". TI, as it is called, is a method focused on efficiency and relaxation in the water. The geek in me loved it. I re-read the book, decided to self-learn by it. I would take the book to pool, practiced the drills, and something clicked.

On my birthday, I swam 50 meters nonstop for the first time.

By September, 1km nonstop. I could swim, relax, and let my mind wander. All at the same time.

But the real battle was mental. Soon, winters came and local pool closed. Only option was pool an hour away. Swimming at 6am in Delhi winters, leaving home in pitch dark. Moving to a 7ft deep pool with no one watching my back (Anubhav chose that 1500km Delhi to Mumbai ride). Some mornings I cursed myself. But I persisted. The fear faded.

**Running** came next. I improved fast. Until my knee started screaming at the 3km mark. The Airtel Delhi Half Marathon was coming up. I was adamant about running it.

My coach scolded me into withdrawing. "Live to die another day."

I hated that decision. It was the right one.

I changed shoes, moved to flat shoes (I still run in flat shoes). Fixed form. Started over. 

In January 2017, I ran my first half marathon. Nearly 4 hours. Zero knee pain. I was buzzing.

## First Triathlon

February 19, 2017. Delhi International Triathlon. My first ever triathlon : and I'd jumped straight into the Half Ironman distance.

The alarm went off at 4am to a Bollywood song : "Aa dekhe jara, kis mein kitna hai dum." *Let's see who has the guts.* Apt, very apt. (I still play this song before every race)

Seven hours and 45 minutes later, it was done. I was hooked.

## The Moment I Almost Quit

Two more Half Ironmans later, I signed up for the real thing : Ironman Philippines, Subic Bay. I picked it because it was closest to my 40th birthday.

Anubhav and I flew in four days early for sea swim practice. Neither of us had ever swum in the ocean.

Practice day. Anubhav was in the water before I'd even figured out my borrowed Garmin. Standing alone on the beach did nothing for my nerves.

I started swimming. First 50 meters, fine.

Then the sea floor dropped away. Crystal-clear water. I could see exactly how far down the bottom was.

My mind declared : "Panic. You are going to die."

I hyperventilated, thrashed back to shore, stood there breathing hard.

Remember, till date, all the swimming I've done in the pool. Where the floor is always visible. No one warned me of this. 

I still remember that moment vividly. Every part of me wanted to walk away. But I knew if I left now, the fear would be ten times worse on race day. My Ironman would be over before it began. The cliche saying came in my mind : "You didn't come this far only to come this far"

Deep breaths. Back in the water. Slow strokes. 100 meters. Pause. 150 meters. Turn back.

I reached the shore grinning. I did it!!

I still look back at that day : 1st June, two days before the race. As someone said - Bravery isn't the absence of fear. It's doing things despite it.

## Race Day : June 3, 2018

Asia's toughest Ironman course. 2000 meters of elevation on the bike. Seasoned athletes comparing it to Kona (World Toughest Ironman, world championship venue)

**The swim** was almost anticlimax after all that panic, as it stormed the night before and sea water was all murky.

Counting breaths to drown out the chaos of a thousand jostling bodies, I entered the sea and started swimming. Exited after 1 hour 42 minutes. Right on plan.

**The bike** was brutal. A 6% climb in the opening kilometers. Heavy rain at 130km. Relentless headwinds after that. Every pedal stroke a negotiation with my body.

Nearly 8 hours. Over an hour slower than my worst estimate.

**The marathon.** My debut Ironman was also my debut marathon. 5pm. Eleven hours in. Never run more than 25km in training.

I met Vijay, another first-timer. We ran and walked together for 25 kilometers, pushing each other through the dark phase.

With 7km left and 40 minutes to make sub-16, I went all out. A pace I hadn't done even on fresh legs. Those last kilometers were agonizing and beautiful. I told my mind to shut up. I overtook people. Mike Reilly's voice grew louder.

I sprinted the red carpet. Jumped at the end.

**15 hours, 57 minutes. Two months before I turned 40.**

## What Came After

That first Ironman was never the end. The bug had bitten too deep.

**Copenhagen 2019.** Cold, rainy Denmark. Panicked again during the practice swim  : wetsuit felt like it was strangling me. But race day? Experience kicked in. Finished with the Indian flag on my shoulders. 14:22.

**Covid** wiped out three years of racing. But I kept training. Quietly building.

**Italy 2022.** Bad Covid weeks before the race. Friends reminded me I'm not a professional. I'm in this for fitness and fun. I let go of expectations.

Something magical happened. Nutrition dialed in. Stayed aero on the bike. And the marathon? Didn't walk once. First time ever in an Ironman. 13:16, grinning the entire last loop.

**Barcelona 2024.** The breakthrough. Sub-12 hours. A time I once thought was beyond me. Every lesson from every race, finally clicking together.

This June (2025), in Franfurt I did my fifth full ironman. So far.

## Why Any of This Matters

People ask me why. Why 16 hours of pain? Why 4am alarms in Delhi winters? Why sign up when you can barely float?

Here's what I've learned : the Ironman was never really about the Ironman.

It was about discovering that the person I thought I was :  the non-athlete, the guy who couldn't swim, the 38-year-old who had no business being on a starting line ,  was just a story I'd been telling myself.

**And stories can be rewritten.**

Every time I stood on a beach terrified to get in the water. Every time my knee screamed and I had to choose between ego and patience. Every time I hit the 130km mark and my mind begged me to stop. Those were the moments that changed me. Not the finish lines. The dark phases.

The lesson isn't about triathlon. It's simpler than that.

**Do hard things.**

Not because they'll be fun. Not because you'll be good at them. Do them because on the other side of that fear, that exhaustion, that voice telling you to quit , there's a version of you that doesn't exist yet.

Start small. Be consistent. Tell everyone what you're chasing so quitting isn't an option. And when it sucks, and it will, keep moving. The struggle *is* the point.

Five Ironmans later, I still get nervous before every race. My heart still spikes in open water. My mind still whispers "turn back."

But I know what's on the other side now. And that changes everything.

The red carpet. The voice on the loudspeaker. And six words that remind me what's possible :

**"Rishi Sareen, you are an Ironman."**
