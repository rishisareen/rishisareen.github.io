A few years ago, I made a bold decision: **I stopped reading the news.**

At first, it felt weird. Almost irresponsible. The world is constantly changing — shouldn’t I stay updated? But over time, I realized that quitting the news didn’t make me ignorant. It made me *free*.

Here’s why.

#### **1. News is Designed to Hijack Your Attention**

Modern news isn't just information. It’s entertainment wrapped in fear. News headlines are designed to grab your attention — usually by making you feel angry, anxious, or shocked. The more you click, the more money they make

Rolf Dobelli, in *The Art of Thinking Clearly*, puts it perfectly:

> *“News is to the mind what sugar is to the body: appetizing, easy to digest — and highly destructive in the long run.”*

The constant stream of negativity distorts your worldview. It makes rare, dramatic events feel like everyday occurrences. And it keeps your brain in a low-level state of stress.

#### **2. News Makes You Dumber (Not Smarter)**

This sounds harsh, but it’s true. News rarely explains anything — it just dumps fragmented facts on you. And accumulating more facts doesn’t actually help you understand the world.

If information alone led to wisdom, journalists would be billionaires with six-pack abs. But that’s not how it works. Real understanding comes from depth, not constant updates.

#### **3. Most News is Irrelevant (or Out of Your Control)**

Think back to the last 100 news articles you read. How many of them actually affected your life? And of those, how many required immediate action?

The truth is, most news is either irrelevant to your day-to-day decisions or completely beyond your influence. Knowing about a political crisis halfway across the world might feel important, but unless you’re in a position to change it, that knowledge just becomes mental clutter.

As Nassim Taleb says:

> *“If news is important, it will find you.”*

When something truly impactful happens, you’ll hear about it — through friends, colleagues, or even a headline you accidentally stumble upon. You don’t need to chase it.

#### **4. The Alternative: Curate What You Consume**

Quitting the news doesn’t mean living in a bubble. It means switching from passive consumption to intentional learning.

Instead of scrolling headlines, I started:

- Reading books and long-form articles for in-depth knowledge.
- Following a few trusted newsletters that summarize key events.
- Listening to long form podcasts that explore topics with nuance (not hype).

I still stay informed — but on my terms, not on a media company’s content treadmill.

#### **The Result: More Peace, More Focus**

Without the constant noise of breaking news, my mind is quieter.I can focus on my goals and feel more in control — because I’m not wasting energy on things I can’t change.

It’s a small shift that made a massive difference. And if the idea of quitting news feels too drastic, try this: **Take a one-week break.** See how it feels. You might not go back.
