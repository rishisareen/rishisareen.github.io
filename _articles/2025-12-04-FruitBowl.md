# Method (Takes < 5 minutes)

1. **Protein-Yogurt Base**
   - In a bowl, whisk yogurt with whey protein until smooth and creamy.
   - If too thick, add 1–2 tbsp cold water or milk. I add water.
2. **Layer Fruits**
   - Add sliced banana.
   - Add strawberries and blueberries.
3. **Add Crunch + Healthy Fats**
   - Sprinkle almonds.
   - Add all four seeds (chia, flax, pumpkin, sunflower).
   - Tip: Add chia last so it doesn’t clump in the yogurt.
4. **Finish Like a Chef**
   - Light drizzle of honey (optional).
   - Sprinkle cinnamon (optional) 
   - If you want it **thicker**, refrigerate chia + yogurt mix for 10 min before adding fruits.
