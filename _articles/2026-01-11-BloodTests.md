## 3. Inflammation, Micronutrients, Aging Markers

| Serum Ferritin        | Annually  | 40–100 ng/mL               | Measures iron stores; low levels cause fatigue even with normal hemoglobin |
| Homocysteine          | Annually  | <10–12 μmol/L              | Signals vitamin B12/folate deficiency and vascular aging                   |
| Vitamin D (25-OH)     | Annually  | 40–80 ng/mL                | Assesses vitamin D status for bones, immunity, muscles                     |

Notes:
- Calcium is a safety marker, not a vitamin D absorption test  
- Add PTH only if vitamin D is low or calcium abnormal

## Interpretation Guide (High-Level)

### Cardiovascular
- High ApoB with normal LDL = too many harmful particles  
- CAC >0 indicates existing artery disease  
- High Lp(a) requires stricter cholesterol control  

### Metabolic
- Normal sugar but high insulin = early metabolic trouble  
- Rising HbA1c predicts future diabetes  

### Inflammation
- hs-CRP >2 mg/L suggests vascular inflammation  
- High homocysteine accelerates aging and brain decline  

### Nutrients
- Vitamin D <30 ng/mL needs correction  
- High calcium with supplements suggests overdose risk  
- B12 <400 pg/mL can cause nerve damage  

### Liver and Kidney
- Mildly high ALT often signals fatty liver  
- Falling eGFR trend matters more than a single value

## Key Principles

- Separate measured tests from calculated indices  
- Avoid unnecessary annual imaging  
- Track trends over time  
- Act early before disease appears
